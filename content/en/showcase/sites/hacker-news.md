description: "Itâ€™s like Reddit but for developers! Hacker News is the go-to site for developer news related to all the things that might be weighing on your mind at any given time. Case in point: hundreds of developers hopped on to discuss the massive AWS S3 outage on February 28, 2017. Few can appreciate the epic disaster caused by such an outage than your fellow developers."
