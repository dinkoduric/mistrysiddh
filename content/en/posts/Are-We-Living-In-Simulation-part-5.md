## Recap

As in [part 1](https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation/) we have talked about **Quantum Computers**, **Facebook AI Chat**, and **Predictions of AI Robots** where in [part 2](https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-2/) we had a recap of **part 1** and also **The Matrix** movie, **Roswell UFO Incident**, where in [part 3](https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-3/) we discussed on [**MKUltra**](https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-3/#what-is-mkultra) performed by `US Central Intelligence Agency`, [`Black Mirror: Bandersnatch`](https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-3/#black-mirror-bandersnatch) movie where you can control **Stefan Butler** by given two choices which leads to different path in the movies. In [part 4](https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-4/) we talked about [UFO](http://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-4/#ufo) also we seen [Space Mysteries](http://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-4/#space-mysteries) of `Restored Apollo 11` and also we seen the video a mysterious video where an unidentified spacecraft refueling itself from sun.

## What is Time?

<sup>Wikipedia</sup> Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events occur in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future. It is a component quantity of various measurments used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events ot the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in the materirial and reality or in the conscious experiance. Time is offen referred to as a fourth dimention, along with three spatial dimensions.

Its been told that time has never stop or will never be stopped its a continuse flow. If we try to make changes in past or future it will effect the path one mistake and everthing is messed up.


### Time Travel
![Time](/images/posts/time.jpg)

Time travel is the convept of movement between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space by an object or a person, typically with the use of a hypothetical device known as a time machine.

### Can we go back in time?
![Predestination](/images/posts/predestination.jpg)

Although humans can't hop into a time machine and go back in time, we do know that clocks on airplanes  and satellites travels at a different speed then those on earth.

#### When did we knew that time travel is possible?

More than 100 years ago, a famous scientist named Albert Einstein came up with an idea about how time works. He called it relativity. This theory says that time and space are linked together. Einstein also said our universe has a speed limit: nothing can travel faster than the speed of light (186,000 miles per second).

## Who was Sid Hurwich?
![Sid Hurwich](/images/posts/sidhurwich.jpg)

Born in 1918, Sid Hurwich was a Jewish appliance repairman living in Toronto Canada who used to experiment with various kinds of technology. As a child, Sid showed great interest in collecting random junk and assembling the pieces into working machines. Later as an adult, he became famous as the man who could fix anything that was broken.

In 1934, Sid earned the distinction of being the first private appliance repairman in all of Canada. He was such a skilled technician that the local power company succeeded in taking him out of the army so he could develop the infrastructure of the public electrical utility.

Sid Hurwich earned enough money to set up two successful companies of his own. He was still young when he got a heart attack, only 36 and he retired.

### EXTRAORDINARY TIME MACHINE THAT COULD ‚ÄòFREEZE TIME‚Äô
However, he continued to experiment with technology and finally invented that extraordinary ‚Äòfreeze time‚Äô machine that could also change flow of time, and send out beams of influence to manipulate objects in distant locations.

Local authorities had problems to catch thieves in the wave of bank robberies that swept Toronto in 1969. So Hurwich contacted them and said that is possible to freeze time to find out what happened.

This account was given in article in the Vancouver Sun Times:
>‚ÄòAll I recall,‚Äô said Bolton (one of the police officers in charge), ‚Äòis that it was under the table ‚Äì the device, whatever it was ‚Äì and there was a bedspread over the table. He froze my service revolver. You couldn‚Äôt pull the trigger, you couldn‚Äôt lift it up off the table and even on the table you couldn‚Äôt pull the trigger.‚Äô

and than Sid said:
>‚Äú‚Ä¶. Now take a look at your watches.‚Äù I remember one of them said, ‚ÄúWhen did this happen?‚Äù and I said, ‚ÄúThe minute you walked through that door. You walked in there about 25 minutes ago. Now look at your watches. You‚Äôre late about 25 minutes.‚Äù‚Äô As the security officers filed out of his home, Sid‚Äôs wife overheard one of them suggest that the army should be told about the device. ‚ÄòThat was the first time it entered my mind for war or army purposes or anything like that.‚Äô

The time machine later was used by military and it ended up in Israel, accorded in publication Foreign Report in 1977. 

>‚ÄúThe device sends out electronic rays to alter the natural composition of electronic fields and centres of gravity of weapons, instrument dials and mechanical devices ‚Ä¶ (using) the Hurwich principle there was no reason why the new beams could not reach and disable tanks, ground-to-ground missiles and complete radar systems. The beams could also be tacked together to form a screen that would make whole zones safe from bombs and missiles,‚Äù

But does they still have that device and does they still use it?


### What happened to Sid Hurwich and his time-altering machine?

Whether the time machine is still in possession of the Israeli military or not has been widely debated. Does the Israeli military still have the Hurwich device, and are they still using it on ‚Äòspecial occasions‚Äô or in dire situations of military crisis?

In ‚ÄòTrue Time Travel‚Äô book by Richard Bullivant is written:
>‚ÄúSkeptics say that if they really had a device that could provide a kind of shield from bombs and missiles, freeze weapons, and even slow or halt time, the Israeli military would be invincible and would not have suffered as many casualties as it has in its decades long struggles with its antagonists in the Mideast. Others counter, however, by saying that the Hurwich device may be a two-edged sword. If it can ‚Äòfreeze‚Äô the weapons of the enemy, it would also freeze the weapons of those employing the device. Thus, the device can perhaps only be used in a limited way ‚Äì enough to knock out radar detection and other enemy electronics, for example ‚Äì but not to induce the full-blown time-freeze affect for the benefit of the user.‚Äù 

Not only Richard wrote about it, but and many people over the years. Also he said to police that it is not a new invention,and it is designed on principles that are already well known.

By now, researchers still can‚Äôt find out any information about him or his obituary. But it is sure that he has passed on.


## Proof or Fake
Proof of time travel: Physicists says that theorietical time trave is prossibel on both sides means in the future and the past. In fact, time travel to the future seems practically possible.

### Mike Tyson Match
![Mike Tyson Match](/images/posts/mike-tyson-match.gif)

In 1995 a match was played between the legendary boxers Mike Tyson and Peter McNeeley. It was not an extraordinary match.

 But, when the footage of the match was watched closely next something unbelievable thing saw in the footage. In the footage, it was clear that someone was capturing the picture of Mike Tyson with a Smartphone.

 In fact, at that time, there was no existence of such types of smartphones.

 It is believed that he was that person who came from the future.
