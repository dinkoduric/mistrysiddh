## What is Time?

<sup>Wikipedia</sup> Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events occur in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future. It is a component quantity of various measurments used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events ot the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in the materirial and reality or in the conscious experiance. Time is offen referred to as a fourth dimention, along with three spatial dimensions.

Its been told that time has never stop or will never be stopped its a continuse flow. If we try to make changes in past or future it will effect the path one mistake and everthing is messed up.


### Time Travel
![Time](/images/posts/time.jpg)

Time travel is the convept of movement between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space by an object or a person, typically with the use of a hypothetical device known as a time machine.

### Can we go back in time?
![Predestination](/images/posts/predestination.jpg)

Although humans can't hop into a time machine and go back in time, we do know that clocks on airplanes  and satellites travels at a different speed then those on earth.

#### When did we knew that time travel is possible?

More than 100 years ago, a famous scientist named Albert Einstein came up with an idea about how time works. He called it relativity. This theory says that time and space are linked together. Einstein also said our universe has a speed limit: nothing can travel faster than the speed of light (186,000 miles per second).

## Who was Sid Hurwich?
![Sid Hurwich](/images/posts/sidhurwich.jpg)

Born in 1918, Sid Hurwich was a Jewish appliance repairman living in Toronto Canada who used to experiment with various kinds of technology. As a child, Sid showed great interest in collecting random junk and assembling the pieces into working machines. Later as an adult, he became famous as the man who could fix anything that was broken.

In 1934, Sid earned the distinction of being the first private appliance repairman in all of Canada. He was such a skilled technician that the local power company succeeded in taking him out of the army so he could develop the infrastructure of the public electrical utility.

Sid Hurwich earned enough money to set up two successful companies of his own. He was still young when he got a heart attack, only 36 and he retired.

### EXTRAORDINARY TIME MACHINE THAT COULD ‚ÄòFREEZE TIME‚Äô
However, he continued to experiment with technology and finally invented that extraordinary ‚Äòfreeze time‚Äô machine that could also change flow of time, and send out beams of influence to manipulate objects in distant locations.

Local authorities had problems to catch thieves in the wave of bank robberies that swept Toronto in 1969. So Hurwich contacted them and said that is possible to freeze time to find out what happened.

This account was given in article in the Vancouver Sun Times:
>‚ÄòAll I recall,‚Äô said Bolton (one of the police officers in charge), ‚Äòis that it was under the table ‚Äì the device, whatever it was ‚Äì and there was a bedspread over the table. He froze my service revolver. You couldn‚Äôt pull the trigger, you couldn‚Äôt lift it up off the table and even on the table you couldn‚Äôt pull the trigger.‚Äô

and than Sid said:
>‚Äú‚Ä¶. Now take a look at your watches.‚Äù I remember one of them said, ‚ÄúWhen did this happen?‚Äù and I said, ‚ÄúThe minute you walked through that door. You walked in there about 25 minutes ago. Now look at your watches. You‚Äôre late about 25 minutes.‚Äù‚Äô As the security officers filed out of his home, Sid‚Äôs wife overheard one of them suggest that the army should be told about the device. ‚ÄòThat was the first time it entered my mind for war or army purposes or anything like that.‚Äô

The time machine later was used by military and it ended up in Israel, accorded in publication Foreign Report in 1977. 

>‚ÄúThe device sends out electronic rays to alter the natural composition of electronic fields and centres of gravity of weapons, instrument dials and mechanical devices ‚Ä¶ (using) the Hurwich principle there was no reason why the new beams could not reach and disable tanks, ground-to-ground missiles and complete radar systems. The beams could also be tacked together to form a screen that would make whole zones safe from bombs and missiles,‚Äù

But does they still have that device and does they still use it?


### What happened to Sid Hurwich and his time-altering machine?

Whether the time machine is still in possession of the Israeli military or not has been widely debated. Does the Israeli military still have the Hurwich device, and are they still using it on ‚Äòspecial occasions‚Äô or in dire situations of military crisis?

In ‚ÄòTrue Time Travel‚Äô book by Richard Bullivant is written:
>‚ÄúSkeptics say that if they really had a device that could provide a kind of shield from bombs and missiles, freeze weapons, and even slow or halt time, the Israeli military would be invincible and would not have suffered as many casualties as it has in its decades long struggles with its antagonists in the Mideast. Others counter, however, by saying that the Hurwich device may be a two-edged sword. If it can ‚Äòfreeze‚Äô the weapons of the enemy, it would also freeze the weapons of those employing the device. Thus, the device can perhaps only be used in a limited way ‚Äì enough to knock out radar detection and other enemy electronics, for example ‚Äì but not to induce the full-blown time-freeze affect for the benefit of the user.‚Äù 

Not only Richard wrote about it, but and many people over the years. Also he said to police that it is not a new invention,and it is designed on principles that are already well known.

By now, researchers still can‚Äôt find out any information about him or his obituary. But it is sure that he has passed on.


## Proof or Fake
Proof of time travel: Physicists says that theorietical time trave is prossibel on both sides means in the future and the past. In fact, time travel to the future seems practically possible.

### Mike Tyson Match
![Mike Tyson Match](/images/posts/mike-tyson-match.gif)

In 1995 a match was played between the legendary boxers Mike Tyson and Peter McNeeley. It was not an extraordinary match.

 But, when the footage of the match was watched closely next something unbelievable thing saw in the footage. In the footage, it was clear that someone was capturing the picture of Mike Tyson with a Smartphone.

 In fact, at that time, there was no existence of such types of smartphones.

 It is believed that he was that person who came from the future.

### Charlie Chaplin Moive
![Charlie Chaplin Moive](/images/posts/charlie-chaplin-moive.jpg)

‚ÄúThe Circus‚Äù was the super hit movie of Charlie Chaplin which was released in 1928.

 Later, when someone was watching the movie closely, he saw unusual stuff in the movie.

 He saw there was a scene in the movie in which a lady was talking on a mobile phone like device.

 But at that time there was no existence of a mobile phone. The first mobile cell phone came into existence in 1973 which was of Motorola. Here is video of it.

 ### London Bridge Opening
 ![London Bridge Opening](/images/posts/bridge-time-traveler.jpg)

 Out of all proofs of time travel, this assumes to be solid evidence of time travel.

 This photo was captured in 1941, during the re-opening ceremony of the South Fork Bridge in Gold Bridge, British Columbia.

 The style of wearing a man‚Äôs clothes in this photo is completely contrasting from other people.

 One gentleman is wearing a graphic t-shirt and black sunglass.

 Moreover, there is also a modern camera like device in his hand.

 But at that time all these things were not existed, which means these kinds of stuff were not invented.

 Later the forensic report was also carried out of this photo but this image was found clean and clear; there was no tampering with it.

### A man from 2256
![A man from 2256](/images/posts/man-from-2256.jpg)

A 44-year-old man [Andrew Carlssin](https://www.quora.com/Was-Andrew-Carlssin-actually-from-the-future) was arrested on Jan 28, 2003, in Toronto, Canada, by FBI. He was detained on the suspicion of illegal inside information of the stock market.

 Because on the course of two weeks by investing just $800 he made out with over $350 million.

 How was it possible? He made out around 126 high-risk trades and never loses a single cent.

 And, during the four-hour confession, he stated he came from 2256.

 In fact, the FBI did not get any evidence of fraud from his side.

 On 3rd April 2003, an unidentified person came in the courtroom for a bail hearing and deposited $1 million for the bail of Andrew Carlssin. But after, they disappeared in the way and never have been met again.

 Later, the FBI could not find out where both of them came from and where they went.

 ### Swiss ring watch
 ![Swiss ring watch](/images/posts/swiss-ring-watch.png)

 A watch was discovered when archaeologists began unsealing a tomb in China. That tomb was from the Ming Dynasty, and it was of 400-year-old.

 While unsealing they found a ring-like object inside the tomb. After investigation, it was found out that it was a small watch similar to be modern Swiss watch. This watch was 100 years old.
 Interestingly, when you see the watch from the front, you can read the time clearly on it.

 Moreover, archaeologists also found there was no tampering with the tomb.

 Consequently, if there was no tampering then how this watch went inside the 300-year-old tomb.

 Astonishingly, at that time even Switzerland didn‚Äôt become a country. Many people correlate this puzzling discovery to time travel.

### 1500 years old mummy wearing adidas sneaker shoe
![1500 years old mummy wearing adidas sneaker shoe](/images/posts/1500-years-old-mummy-wearing-adidas-sneaker-shoe.jpg)

The Mongolian Mummy was found in the Altai Mountains at the height of 10,000 feet from the ocean.

 This mummy was of the 1500 years old, and the stunning thing about this was that this mummy was wearing Adidas like sneakers in her feet. (this mummy was assumed to be of a woman)

 Adidas is a German company started on August 18, 1949, by Adi Dassler and it is famous for its footwear.

 Some people are relating the story of this mummy with the event of time travel.

 This mummy was found in April 2016.

### 17th century astronaut
![17th century astronaut](/images/posts/Resolved_Mystery_Of_Salamanca_Astronaut_From_The_Cathedral_Of_16th_Century.png)
Very few are aware that the Soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin was the first person to travel to outer space in 1961. But the mystery remains unveiled is why there a figure that exactly looks like an astronaut engraved in the stone of a 16th-century cathedral?

Built between 1513 and 1733 there is a new cathedral of Salamanca, Spain when space travel was hardly thought of. This has made some people curious to speculate about the origin of the carving: is this the evidence of time travel? Or some other creatures from different planet engraved it? Or is some paranormal force at a play?

The Salamanca‚Äôs Astronaut is not a joke or a hoax, but a modern addition to the Cathedral; however, it has all the reserves of something which may provide confusion some 400 years from now. 

**New Cathedral Of Salamanca**
The building began at a time when the Gothic style was merging with the new Renaissance style. This cathedral retained more of its gothic counter because the administrators and the supervisors wanted the new cathedral to merge with the old one. Two elements were added that broke with the predominant style of the building: a Baroque and the bell tower.

The new cathedral of Salamanca was erected without the destruction of the old cathedral, but the walls of the newly erected lean on the North wall of the old one. This is the reason why the old cathedral had to be reinforced. The main entrance to the cathedral consists of three decorated arcs: each heading to the three naves of the church.

**Who Did Carve The Astronaut Picture On The Cathedral?**

The truth behind this carving is, unfortunately, less interesting. When the church was rebuilt centuries ago it went a restoration program and the stonemasons decided to carve some modern figures. It is a tradition of the cathedral builders to add details or new carvings as a sort of some signature. In this case with the cathedral, quarryman Jeronimo Garcia given the action to add more images to the front of the building including an astronaut among some vines.

There also been a weird looking dragon eating ice cream (even the ice cream cones were not invented until the 20th century), a bull, a crayfish and a lynx.  But why the figures are chipped and broken even though it is not that much old? Vandalism in 2010

![unidentified image](/images/posts/unidentified.jpg)
The vandalism has been recovered and now it has clear pictures today.

It is the only church that has some modern addition engraved on the building, Calahorra Cathedral in Spain (from the 16th century) has a cell phone that was added in 1996.
