Wordpress is the most leading CMS (Content management system) right now in current generation there are also many similar to wordpress.

### List of other CMS:
1. [Wix](https://www.wix.com/) (most flexible designs)
2. [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/) (extremely easy)
3. [Jimdo](https://www.jimdo.com/) (AI-powered sites)
4. [Joomla!](https://www.joomla.com/) (complex but powerful)

There are many site which are running this CMS top popular site to non-popular sites, small scale developer to large scale developer. My first site was also a blog which was hosted on [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com) which had limited function after then i found a free hosting server where i manually hosted my site but due to server went down i stopped developing my site.

There are many plugin and theme for the sites to customize the way you want also there are some plugins which are payable but give you customize the way you want. It has a large archive or you can say storage of plugins, theme etc. This type of hosting has many disadvantage and many advantages depending on which type of hosting you want. [Softaculous](https://remote.softaculous.com/) is a software which is been used by hosting provider to install different types of forums, blog, portal/CMS, wikis, mail, e-commerce, frameworks etc.
