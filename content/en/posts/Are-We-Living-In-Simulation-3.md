> According to Wikipedia

`Project MKUltra (or MK-Ultra)` also known as `CIA mind control Program`, is the code name given to a program of experiments on human subjects that were designed and undertaken by the `US Central Intelligence Agency`, some of which were illegal. Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations in order to be used in interrogation in order to weaken the individual and force confessions through mind control. The project was organized through the `Office of Scientific Intelligence` of the CIA and coordinated with the `United State Army Biological Warfare Laboratories`. Other code name for the drug related experiments were `Project Bluebird` and `Project Artichoke`.



The operation was officially sanctioned in 1953, reduced in scope in 1964 and further curtailed in 1967. it was officially halted in 1973. The program also engaged in illegal activities, including the used of US and Canadian citizens as its unwitting test subjects, which led to controversy regarding it legitimacy. MKUltra used numerous methods to manipulate its subjects' mental states and brain functions. Techniques included the covert administration of high doses of [psychoactive drug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug) (especially [LSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD)) and other chemicals, electroshocks, hypnosis, sensory, deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of torture.



The scope of Project MKUltra was broad, with research undertaken at more then 80 institutions, including colleges and universities hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies. The CIA operated using front organizations, although sometimes top of officials at these institutions were aware of the CIA's involvement.



Project MKUltra was first brought to public attention in 1975 by the `Church Committee` of the `United States Congress` and `Gerald Ford's United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States` (also known as the Rockefeller Commission).



Investigative effects were hampered by CIA Director `Richard Helms` order that all MKUltra files by `destroyed in 1973` the Church Committee and `Rockefeller Commission` investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the relatively small number of documents that survived Helms's destruction order. In 1997, a `Freedom of Information Act` requested uncovered a cache of `20,000 documents` related to project MKUltra which led to senate hearings later that year. Some surviving information regarding MKUltra was declassified in `July 2001`. In `December 2018`, declassified documents included a letter to an unidentified doctor discussing work on six dogs made to run, turn and stop via remote control and brain implants.
