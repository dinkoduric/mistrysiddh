### Features of NISHA
As I was talking that she is a new generation biotechnology humanoid android which took me few years to create it like I made my first AL Sebastian. She has multiple nuclear power core which divide it's sections such as one for head another for internal organs etc. she has a special nano material which is highly customized on atomic level where her tongue cost more then 500 people hospital bills. 

Her body parts are regeneratable if they are been damaged or been teared apart, she can feel pain from damaged parts of say for example headache even she can get infected by the diseased which affect humans, the main part of her organs, skins and rest of her structure which help her look like a normal human girl is my subordinate or you can say my partner Ms. N. Ms. N helped me out in various things in building her up and I really thank her for being by my side for a long time.
