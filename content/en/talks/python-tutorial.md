## Operation
- `' '` or `" "` = quotes (use in print command to print single line)
- `""" """` = three quotes (use to print multiple line in a single print line)
- `+` = addition (use for mathematical operation)
- `-` = subtraction (use for mathematical operation)
- `/` = division (use for mathematical operation)
- `*` = multiplication (use for mathematical operation)
- `()` = circular brackets (parentheses use for mathematical operation)
- `**` = exponentiation (power of the value e.g. `2^2` or `2**2` = 4 like a square or cube)
- `%` = modulo operator (to get remainder of given division e.g. `5%2 = 1` where 1 is remainder)
- `//` = quotient (two forward slashes which is used to get quotient of given division e.g. `5//2 = 2` where 2 is the quotient)
- `\` = backslash (use for escaping e.g. `"He\'s good at games."` which will appear as He's good at games.)
- `\n` = new lines (to print new line in a single code) e.g.

```python
# example code
print('first line\nsecond line')
# output
first line
second line
```

- `\t` = tab (this is for use tab in the code)

```python
# example code
print('this is a \ttab.')
# output
this is a	tab.
```

This are the operation which will be using in the programming where it may be some addition some conditions etc. there may be more but I know this much only. So stick with it.

## Data Types

- String = " (quotes) or " " (quotation marks) e.g. 'Python' or "Python!"
- Float = decimal points `.` e.g. `34.546`
- Int = integer value or whole number e.g. `564`
- Concatenation = concatenation is used to add any 2 or more than 2 data either it may be string or float or int e.g. "hey my no. is " + 53 = hey my no. is 53

```python
# example code
print("hey my no. is " + 53)
# output
hey my no. is 53
```

- If you use multiplication in concatenation than it will print the statement as many time as the number, you have been multiplied e.g. "a"*3 = aaa

```python 
# example code
print("a" * 5)
# output
aaaaa
```
