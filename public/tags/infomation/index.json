She uses to always say to us that we should be happy with what we have even a little bit don\u0026rsquo;t ever say that I don\u0026rsquo;t have this or that be happy with what is there in your life. When I was in school I use to make mischief soo much but at the same time, we use to listen to our teachers also, truth to say my scores were not that much compare to other students even I was lazy in writing notes when I come into college I thought that it will be easy and all the joy, fun, going out with friends and have lots of enjoyment(according to movies and listing form others too) as soon as I entered in the first year of college I was really happyüòç that I\u0026rsquo;m free I can do whatever I want to do but I was wrong üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è who knew that there was soo many assignments to write and not also that it was given 1 week before submission and sometimes before few days. We all went to sir and talked with them for extending the date of submission sometimes unity work and sometimes opposite(it may happen with you if you\u0026rsquo;re in the Engineering sector and not also that it\u0026rsquo;s been said that jokes are only made on engineering students, not on medical students - I leave this decision up to you)\nFrustration Sometimes I fell soo much frustration and anger that just blast whole education system which is been made, one side its helpful for all students and on the other hand\u0026rsquo;s partiality is been done I don\u0026rsquo;t want to say what partiality is been done for yours and my safety and even you have experienced it also, this will be continued until there is a huge change in the education system. Our society has many faults which are been create by us and faculty also higher authorities officers, first, we have to change due to our change teachers and other higher authorities will change their perspective, if we don\u0026rsquo;t change ourselves then how can we change other by talking. I have many difficulties in collage due to communication language, also I lived in a hostel at a place where nearly about 12-13 km was a forest with no road and there was only one road which connected to city and college and its timing was 5:00 am to 11:00 pm and you know that if you stay in college hostel then there are soo many processes for getting leave pass. I was stuck in a situation where I felt guilt for being in college, that time I was been teenager so its been natural to fall in love with a beautiful, gorgeous, and smart too, but my bad luck my brother fall in love and I was bodyguard protecting them from others catching them üò•(the worst pain ever felt in the historyüò≠).\n write your review down bellow Thank you\n","description":"Let's start a new life with new choices with different opportunities, challenges, experience.

After languishing in Internet obscurity for nearly a year, another Reddit user requested more information, asking: \u0026ldquo;Do these seemingly random strings of numbers \u0026hellip; correlate to something; is there some big joke I‚Äôm missing out on?\u0026rdquo; There was no reply, but enough people began to wonder the same thing themselves, and soon a sister subreddit, r/Solving_A858, was born. It consisted of \u0026ldquo;a dedicated group of computer science students, amateur cryptographers, and motivated enthusiasts\u0026rdquo; working together to crack the code, if indeed that\u0026rsquo;s what it was, reports the Daily Dot. At first, the creator kept the subreddit private, with only those proving themselves worthy allowed in, but it eventually opened to the public. It all started back in 2011 when a Reddit account began posting an indecipherable sequence of numbers and letters to a new subreddit, r/A858DE45F56D9BC9, or r/A858 for short.

At first, the creator kept the subreddit private, with only those proving themselves worthy allowed in, but it eventually opened to the public.\nToday only a few of the thousands of r/A858 posts have been decoded, but they tend to be cryptic‚Äîsuch as an excerpt from the book Actions and Passions by Max Lerner and the ASCII image of Stonehenge, reported Bustle last year. The subreddit creator was pretty much silent until August 2015 when an account appeared in the sister \u0026ldquo;solving\u0026rdquo; subreddit that (after appropriate code-breaking, of course) allowed users to ask questions. Still, any answers were themselves cryptic, such as: \u0026ldquo;We cannot disclose the purpose. A858 will end when the purpose is disclosed or discovered.\u0026rdquo; Then on March 29, after having been private for some time (it switches between private and public regularly), r/A858 suddenly read: \u0026ldquo;The A858 Project Has Concluded. You may unsubscribe.\u0026rdquo; Many still think the project isn\u0026rsquo;t over. \u0026ldquo;I only hope A858 has a purpose,\u0026rdquo; one user writes. \u0026ldquo;I don‚Äôt particularly care if it is a good one.\u0026rdquo;\nIndia India has been called the land of mysteries since time immemorial, whether for its various enigmatic natural phenomena or eccentricities associated with its religions and culture. And while science has worked hard to debunk and find a logical reason behind every riddle, there remain some that give rationalists a run for their money. Here are some of modern India‚Äôs most puzzling aspects that are bound to make your eyes pop!\nKodinhi ‚Äì Kerala‚Äôs village of twins By any metric, conceiving twins and triplets is a rare natural occurrence around the world. In fact, on average only 16 out of 1,000 successful pregnancies in the world result in twins and this average is even lower in India at just 9. However, this ratio is heavily skewed in the sleepy hamlet of Kodinhi in Kerala, which has a record 400 pairs of twins in a population of just over 2,000 families! Geneticists and scientists have long tried to explain this rare phenomenon but are only now making some headway. While experts have pointed to genetics as an obvious factor, what‚Äôs even more mysterious is that irrespective of religion, lineage or their original heritage, all families living in the village have conceived more than the average pairs of twins over the last few generations, and the number is consistently growing.\nTanjore‚Äôs Brihadeeswara Temple The ‚ÄòBig Temple‚Äô in Thanjavur is renowned across the world as an architectural marvel and is one of India‚Äôs 36 World Heritage Sites. While there are many imposing and majestic temples in Tamil Nadu, what makes this temple particularly interesting is its architectural mysteries that still confound many. The granite structure is popular for having one of the tallest gopurams in India and at the apex lies an 81-tonne monolithic Shikhara mounted at a height of 66 meters. While architecture and science have advanced over centuries to create much greater marvels, taken in the context of its era of construction, dating back more than 1,000 years, this aspect of the temple still baffles experts. Questions about how the heavy and huge Shikhara was mounted at such a height and how such massive amounts of granite were carried to the site with no recorded quarries in the vicinity are still unanswered. By some accounts, the tower is constructed in such a way that it does not cast a shadow at noon on any day of the year as well!\nPrahlad Jani ‚Äì India‚Äôs fasting fakir! India is a land of eccentric saints and sadhus, but none of these gurus has raised worldwide interest and flummoxed experts as much as Prahlad Jani, the sadhu who claims to have fasted without food or water for over 40 years. His claims had long been taken with a pinch of salt by scientists and experts and outright dismissed by rationalists. However, in 2010, Jani was part of an extensive study by a team of 35 Indian experts from the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Science, which lasted over 15 days. While the study was shrouded in mystery with the government deciding not to divulge any details, it was widely publicised that the guru, also known as Mataji, was in good health despite not eating or drinking water and being in isolation for more than ten days. What‚Äôs more, it was further claimed that he did not urinate or excrete during the duration of the tests. While the veracity of this account is still an open question, it certainly has raised interest among the world‚Äôs leading experts.\nKirti Stambha ‚Äì the Iron Pillar of Delhi While the concept of rust-resistant iron only became prominent during the industrial revolution in western civilization, there stands an iron pillar in Delhi that predates such known material technology by nearly a millennium! The Kirti Stambha or victory pillar of Delhi is a six-tonne structure that is constructed out of iron sometime in the 5th century and has stood the test of time without succumbing to rust. The science of this pillar has baffled scientists, primarily for the fact that such advanced technology for rust resistance was thought to be unknown elsewhere in the world at the time.\n","description":"Have you thought that there are internet mysteries too where some are been solved and some are not the internet is like an ocean where we don't know what will happen also we don't know who is spying on us what we search etc.","id":23,"section":"posts","tags":["matrix","simulation","reality","truth","experiment"],"title":"Are We Living in Simulation Part 6","uri":"https://mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-6/"},{"content":"\r\rRecap As in part 1, we have talked about Quantum Computers, Facebook AI Chat, and Predictions of AI Robots wherein part 2 we had a recap of part 1 and also The Matrix movie, Roswell UFO Incident, wherein part 3 we discussed on MKUltra performed by US Central Intelligence Agency, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch movie where you can control Stefan Butler by given two choices which leads to a different path in the movies.

Wikipedia Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future. It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in the material and reality or the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.\nIt is been told that time has never stopped or will never be stopped its a continuous flow. If we try to make changes in past or future it will affect the path one mistake and everything is messed up.\nTime Travel Time travel is the concept of movement between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space by an object or a person, typically with the use of a hypothetical device known as a time machine.\nCan we go back in time? Although humans can\u0026rsquo;t hop into a time machine and go back in time, we do know that clocks on aeroplanes and satellites travel at a different speed than those on earth.\nWhen did we knew that time travel is possible? More than 100 years ago, a famous scientist named Albert Einstein came up with an idea about how time works. He called it relativity. This theory says that time and space are linked together. Einstein also said our universe has a speed limit: nothing can travel faster than the speed of light (186,000 miles per second).\nWho was Sid Hurwich? Born in 1918, Sid Hurwich was a Jewish appliance repairman living in Toronto Canada who used to experiment with various kinds of technology. As a child, Sid showed great interest in collecting random junk and assembling the pieces into working machines. Later as an adult, he became famous as the man who could fix anything that was broken.\nIn 1934, Sid earned the distinction of being the first private appliance repairman in all of Canada. He was such a skilled technician that the local power company succeeded in taking him out of the army so he could develop the infrastructure of the public electrical utility.\nSid Hurwich earned enough money to set up two successful companies of his own. He was still young when he got a heart attack, only 36 and he retired.\nEXTRAORDINARY TIME MACHINE THAT COULD ‚ÄòFREEZE TIME‚Äô However, he continued to experiment with technology and finally invented that extraordinary ‚Äòfreeze time‚Äô machine that could also change the flow of time, and send out beams of influence to manipulate objects in distant locations.\nLocal authorities had problems to catch thieves in the wave of bank robberies that swept Toronto in 1969. So Hurwich contacted them and said that is possible to freeze time to find out what happened.\nThis account was given in the article in the Vancouver Sun-Times:\n ‚ÄòAll I recall,‚Äô said Bolton (one of the police officers in charge), ‚Äòis that it was under the table ‚Äì the device, whatever it was ‚Äì and there was a bedspread over the table. He froze my service revolver. You couldn‚Äôt pull the trigger, you couldn‚Äôt lift it off the table and even on the table you couldn‚Äôt pull the trigger.‚Äô\n and then Sid said:\n ‚Äú‚Ä¶. Now take a look at your watches.‚Äù I remember one of them said, ‚ÄúWhen did this happen?‚Äù and I said, ‚ÄúThe minute you walked through that door. You walked in there about 25 minutes ago. Now, look at your watches. You‚Äôre late about 25 minutes.‚Äù‚Äô As the security officers filed out of his home, Sid‚Äôs wife overheard one of them suggest that the army should be told about the device. ‚ÄòThat was the first time it entered my mind for war or army purposes or anything like that.‚Äô\n The time machine later was used by military and it ended up in Israel, accorded in publication Foreign Report in 1977.\n ‚ÄúThe device sends out electronic rays to alter the natural composition of electronic fields and centres of gravity of weapons, instrument dials and mechanical devices ‚Ä¶ (using) the Hurwich principle there was no reason why the new beams could not reach and disable tanks, ground-to-ground missiles and complete radar systems. The beams could also be tacked together to form a screen that would make whole zones safe from bombs and missiles,‚Äù\n But does they still have that device and do they still use it?\nWhat happened to Sid Hurwich and his time-altering machine? Whether the time machine is still in possession of the Israeli military or not has been widely debated. Does the Israeli military still have the Hurwich device, and are they still using it on ‚Äòspecial occasions‚Äô or in dire situations of military crisis?\nIn ‚ÄòTrue Time Travel‚Äô book by Richard Bullivant is written:\n ‚ÄúSkeptics say that if they had a device that could provide a kind of shield from bombs and missiles, freeze weapons, and even slow or halt time, the Israeli military would be invincible and would not have suffered as many casualties as it has in its decades' long struggles with its antagonists in the Mideast. Others counter, however, by saying that the Hurwich device may be a two-edged sword. If it can ‚Äòfreeze‚Äô the weapons of the enemy, it would also freeze the weapons of those employing the device. Thus, the device can perhaps only be used in a limited way ‚Äì enough to knock out radar detection and other enemy electronics, for example ‚Äì but not to induce the full-blown time-freeze effect for the benefit of the user.‚Äù\n Not only Richard wrote about it, but and many people over the years. Also, he said to police that it is not a new invention, and it is designed on principles that are already well known.\nBy now, researchers still can‚Äôt find out any information about him or his obituary. But, surely, he has passed on.\nTruth or Fake Proof of time travel: Physicists says that theoretical time travel is possible on both sides means in the future and the past. Time travel to the future seems practically possible.\n Mike Tyson Match Charlie Chaplin Moive London Bridge Opening A man from 2256 Swiss ring watch 1500 years old mummy wearing adidas sneaker shoe 17th century astronaut The man from Taured John Titor  Mike Tyson Match In 1995 a match was played between the legendary boxers Mike Tyson and Peter McNeeley. It was not an extraordinary match.\nBut, when the footage of the match was watched closely next something unbelievable thing saw in the footage. In the footage, it was clear that someone was capturing the picture of Mike Tyson with a Smartphone.\nIn fact, at that time, there was no existence of such types of smartphones.\nIt is believed that he was that person who came from the future.\nCharlie Chaplin Moive ‚ÄúThe Circus‚Äù was the super hit movie of Charlie Chaplin which was released in 1928.\nLater, when someone was watching the movie closely, he saw unusual stuff in the movie.\nHe saw there was a scene in the movie in which a lady was talking on a mobile phone like device.\nBut at that time there was no existence of a mobile phone. The first mobile cell phone came into existence in 1973 which was of Motorola. Here is the video of it.\n  London Bridge Opening Out of all proofs of time travel, this assumes to be solid evidence of time travel.\nThis photo was captured in 1941, during the re-opening ceremony of the South Fork Bridge in Gold Bridge, British Columbia.\nThe style of wearing a man‚Äôs clothes in this photo is completely contrasting from other people.\nOne gentleman is wearing a graphic t-shirt and black sunglass.\nMoreover, there is also a modern camera like device in his hand.\nBut at that time all these things were not existed, which means these kinds of stuff were not invented.\nLater the forensic report was also carried out of this photo but this image was found clean and clear; there was no tampering with it.\nA man from 2256 A 44-year-old man Andrew Carlssin was arrested on Jan 28, 2003, in Toronto, Canada, by FBI. He was detained on the suspicion of illegal inside information of the stock market.\nBecause on the course of two weeks by investing just $800 he made out with over $350 million.\nHow was it possible? He made out around 126 high-risk trades and never loses a single cent.\nAnd, during the four-hour confession, he stated he came from 2256.\nThe FBI did not get any evidence of fraud from his side.\nOn 3rd April 2003, an unidentified person came in the courtroom for a bail hearing and deposited $1 million for the bail of Andrew Carlssin. But after, they disappeared in the way and never have been met again.\nLater, the FBI could not find out where both of them came from and where they went.\n  Swiss ring watch A watch was discovered when archaeologists began unsealing a tomb in China. That tomb was from the Ming Dynasty, and it was of 400-year-old.\nWhile unsealing they found a ring-like object inside the tomb. After investigation, it was found out that it was a small watch similar to be modern Swiss watch. This watch was 100 years old.\nInterestingly, when you see the watch from the front, you can read the time clearly on it.\nMoreover, archaeologists also found there was no tampering with the tomb.\nConsequently, if there was no tampering then how this watch went inside the 300-year-old tomb.\nAstonishingly, at that time even Switzerland didn‚Äôt become a country. Many people correlate this puzzling discovery to time travel.\n1500 years old mummy wearing Adidas sneaker shoe The Mongolian Mummy was found in the Altai Mountains at the height of 10,000 feet from the ocean.\nThis mummy was of the 1500 years old, and the stunning thing about this was that this mummy was wearing Adidas like sneakers in her feet. (this mummy was assumed to be of a woman)\nAdidas is a German company that started on August 18, 1949, by Adi Dassler and it is famous for its footwear.\nSome people are relating the story of this mummy with the event of time travel.\nThis mummy was found in April 2016.\n17th century astronaut Very few are aware that the Soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin was the first person to travel to outer space in 1961. But the mystery remains unveiled is why there a figure that exactly looks like an astronaut engraved in the stone of a 16th-century cathedral?\nBuilt between 1513 and 1733 there is a new cathedral of Salamanca, Spain when space travel was hardly thought of. This has made some people curious to speculate about the origin of the carving: is this the evidence of time travel? Or some other creatures from different planet engraved it? Or is some paranormal force at a play?\nThe Salamanca‚Äôs Astronaut is not a joke or a hoax, but a modern addition to the Cathedral; however, it has all the reserves of something which may provide confusion some 400 years from now.\nNew Cathedral Of Salamanca\nThe building began at a time when the Gothic style was merging with the new Renaissance style. This cathedral retained more of its gothic counter because the administrators and the supervisors wanted the new cathedral to merge with the old one. Two elements were added that broke with the predominant style of the building: a Baroque and the bell tower.\nThe new cathedral of Salamanca was erected without the destruction of the old cathedral, but the walls of the newly erected lean on the North wall of the old one. This is the reason why the old cathedral had to be reinforced. The main entrance to the cathedral consists of three decorated arcs: each heading to the three naves of the church.\nWho Did Carve The Astronaut Picture On The Cathedral?\nThe truth behind this carving is, unfortunately, less interesting. When the church was rebuilt centuries ago it went a restoration program and the stonemasons decided to carve some modern figures. It is a tradition of the cathedral builders to add details or new carvings as a sort of some signature. In this case with the cathedral, quarryman Jeronimo Garcia given the action to add more images to the front of the building including an astronaut among some vines.\nThere also been a weird looking dragon eating ice cream (even the ice cream cones were not invented until the 20th century), a bull, a crayfish and a lynx. But why the figures are chipped and broken even though it is not that much old? Vandalism in 2010\nThe vandalism has been recovered and now it has clear pictures today.\nIt is the only church that has some modern addition engraved on the building, Calahorra Cathedral in Spain (from the 16th century) has a cell phone that was added in 1996.\nThe man from Taured The Man from Taured (sometimes referred to as the Taured Mystery of the Man Without a Country ) is a story about a man who arrives at a Japanese airport from a country called Taured. Many people have claimed this story to be true, so the crux of the problem pertains to Taured. One would notice that there is no country by the name of Taured, either today or during the purported time when the incident took place, i.e. the 1950s. The story ends with the man disappearing (forever) a day after arriving in Japan. Moreover, all of his documents, such as his passport and driver‚Äôs license also (conveniently) disappeared, thus making this strange story unsolvable.\nThe Man‚Äôs ArrivalThe Man‚Äôs Arrival The story of the ‚ÄòMan from Taured‚Äô begins quite specifically in many sources with a hot day in July 1954. On that particular day, a man was said to have arrived at Haneda Airport, known also as Tokyo International Airport. This man has been described as Caucasian looking with a beard. Whilst his primary language is said to have been French, it has been purported that he spoke Japanese and many other languages as well.\nThe sequence of events then differs according to which version of the story one encounters. In one version, this man hands over his passport to be stamped, and the Japanese immigration officer notices something strange. Whilst the passport looked authentic, the country where it was issued, ‚ÄòTaured‚Äô, was recognized as non-existent, either by the officer or one of his / her colleagues, indicating that the man should be taken away for interrogation. In another version, the man mentioned that he was from Taured, and when the immigration officer did not believe him, he showed him/her his passport.\nLocation of Taured The next part of the story details the man trying to convince the immigration officers that Taured does indeed exist. According to the traveller, Taured was located between France and Spain and had by then been in existence for 1000 years.\nWhen shown a map, the man pointed to the area occupied by the Principality of Andorra and was puzzled as to why his country was called Andorra on the map. Both sides refused to give in ‚Äì the Japanese officers insisted that Taured did not exist, and the traveller argued otherwise.\nLocation of Andorra (center of green circle) in Europe (dark grey).\nVanished! Eventually, the man was held by the officers, as they were suspicious that he might be some kind of criminal. They brought him to a nearby hotel for the night, whilst they conducted their investigation. To ensure that the man did not escape during the night, two guards were placed outside his room. The next morning, when the officers went to the man‚Äôs room, they realized that he had simply vanished, as there were no signs of his escape. Additionally, all of his documents, which may serve as evidence for the story‚Äôs validity, had disappeared as well.\nTravel Through Time or Space? Or Just an Exaggeration? One of the most notable explanations for this incident is that the man from Taured had somehow passed through a parallel dimension by accident, and ended up at Haneda Airport. It has been suggested that, based on this explanation, there is parallel earth which is similar to ours with the exception that the locations called Andorra here is known as Taured over there. Another suggestion is that the man was a time traveller from the future, thou this interpretation is arguably more problematic than the one supposing inter-dimensional travel.\nIt has also been suggested that an incident like that did indeed happen, though perhaps much less sensational. This more mundane story could have been embellished each time it was told, so much so that it eventually evolved into the great mystery that it is known as today.\nFinally, it is also entirely possible that this story is merely an urban legend. The story of the ‚ÄòMan from Taured‚Äô might not have even occurred in the first place, and may have just been the creation of someone‚Äôs imagination.\nJohn Titor  Is this true that this person who was seen on London Bridge Opening.\n\nOne legendary hoax captivated fans of the supernatural and the paranormal like few others. November 2, 2000, saw the first online post by the individual who would come to be known as \u0026ldquo;John Titor.\u0026rdquo; Titor claimed to be a man from the future, sent to the past to retrieve\u0026hellip; a portable computer. Though shrouded by forum avatars, his specific instructions on what he was here to accomplish, and what society would look like in his version of the future, kicked off a frenzy of investigation, speculation, and deception that has lasted for nearly two decades.\nSome people believed \u0026ldquo;John Titor\u0026rdquo; completely. Others became obsessed with errors and inconsistencies, digital detectives trying to uncover the truth behind the story. Before it was over, Titor would make his way to an animation studio in Japan, a wrestling ring in Pennsylvania, and a prison cell in Oregon.\nJohn Titor is a name used on several bulletin boards during 2000 and 2001 by a poster claiming to be an American military time traveller from 2036. Titor made numerous vague and specific predictions regarding calamitous events in 2004 and beyond, attracting world-wide attention during the ensuing decade. His descriptions of the aftermath of a nuclear war‚Äîincluding the devastation of numerous countries around the world, a breakup of the United States into five smaller sovereignties, and general destruction of the global environment and infrastructure‚Äîinspired fiction and music, and triggered investigations by journalists and others. Subsequent closer examination of Titor‚Äôs assertions provoked widespread scepticism. Inconsistencies in his explanations, the uniform inaccuracy of his predictions, and a private investigator‚Äôs findings all led to the general impression that the entire episode was an elaborate hoax. A 2009 investigation concluded that Titor was likely the creation of Larry Haber, a Florida entertainment lawyer, along with his brother John, a computer scientist.\nTitor\u0026rsquo;s Post The first posts using John Titor‚Äôs military symbol appeared on the Time Travel Instituteforums on November 2, 2000, under the name TimeTravel_0. At that time the name ‚ÄúJohn Titor‚Äù was not being used. The posts discussed time travel in general, the first one being the ‚Äúsix parts‚Äù description of what a time machine would need to have to work (see below) and responses to questions about how such a machine would work. Early messages tended to be short. A second thread was also made due to shortcomings in the forum software at the time\nThe name ‚ÄúJohn Titor‚Äù was not introduced until January 2001, when TimeTravel_0 began posting at the Art Bell BBS Forums (which required a name or pseudonym for every account). The Titor posts ended in late March 2001.\nAround 2003, various websites reproduced Titor‚Äôs posts, re-arranging them into narratives. Not all refer to the original dates posted.\nIn his online postings, Titor claimed to be an American soldier from 2036, based in Tampa, Florida. He was assigned to a governmental time-travel project, and sent back to 1975 to retrieve an IBM 5100 computer which he said was needed to debug various legacy computer programs in 2036; a possible reference to the UNIX year 2038 problem. The IBM 5100 runs the APL and BASICprogramming languages.\nTitor had been selected for this mission specifically, given that his paternal grandfather was directly involved with the assembly and programming of the 5100. Titor claimed to be on a stopover in the year 2000 for ‚Äúpersonal reasons,‚Äù to collect pictures lost in the (future) civil war and to visit his family, of whom he spoke often.\nTitor also said he had been, for a few months, trying to alert anyone that would listen about the threat of Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease spread through beef products and about the possibility of civil war within the United States. When questioned about them by an online subscriber, Titor also expressed an interest in mysteries such as UFOs, which remained unexplained in his time. Titor suggested that UFOs and extraterrestrials might be travellers from much further into the future than his own time, with superior time machines.\nTime Machine Titor described his time machine on several occasions. In an early post, he described it as a ‚Äústationary mass, temporal displacement unit powered by two top-spin, dual positive singularities‚Äù, producing a ‚Äústandard off-set Tipler sinusoid‚Äù.\nThe earliest post was more explicit, saying it contained the following:\n Two magnetic housing units for the dual micro singularities An electron injection manifold to alter mass and gravity of the micro singularities A cooling and X-ray venting system Gravity sensors, or a variable gravity lock Four main caesium clocks Three main computer units  According to the posts, the device was installed in the rear of a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette convertible and later moved to a 1987 truck having four-wheel drive.\nTitor shared several scans of the manual of a ‚ÄúC204 Time Displacement Unit‚Äù with diagrams and schematics and posted some photographs of the device installed in the car.\nTitor claimed that the ‚ÄúEverett‚ÄìWheeler model of quantum physics,‚Äù better known as the many-worlds interpretation, was correct. The model posits that every possible outcome of a quantum decision occurs in a separate ‚Äúuniverse.‚Äù Titor stated that this was the reason the grandfather paradox would not happen; following the logic of the argument, Titor would be killing a different John Titor‚Äôs grandfather in a timeline other than his own.\n The grandfather paradox is impossible.\nIn fact, all paradox is impossible. The Everett‚ÄìWheeler‚ÄìGraham or multiple world theory is correct.\nAll possible quantum states, events, possibilities, and outcomes are real, eventual, and occurring.\nThe chances of everything happening someplace at some time in the supervise are 100%.\n Predictions Although invoking the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, whereby events from his timeline may differ from our own, Titor also expressed assurance that the differences were minimal. As such, his descriptions have been interpreted as predictions and compared with historical events since 2001.\nThe most immediate of Titor‚Äôs predictions was of an upcoming civil war in the United States having to do with ‚Äúorder and rights‚Äù.He described it as beginning in 2004, with civil unrest surrounding the presidential election of that year. This civil conflict that he characterized as ‚Äúhaving a Waco type event every month that steadily gets worse‚Äù would be ‚Äúpretty much at everyone‚Äôs doorstep‚Äù and erupt by 2008.\nAs a result of the war, the United States would split into five regions based on various factors and differing military objectives. This civil war, according to Titor, would end in 2015 with a brief but intense World War III.\nTitor refers to the exchange as ‚ÄúN Day‚Äù. Washington, D.C. and Jacksonville, Florida are specifically mentioned as being hit. After the war, Omaha, Nebraska would be the new U.S. capital. Titor was vague as to the exact motivations and causes for World War III. At one point, he characterized the hostilities as being led by ‚Äúborder clashes and overpopulation‚Äù. He also pointed to the contemporary conflict between Arabs and Israel as not a cause, but rather a milestone that precedes World War III.\nTitor claimed that as a 13-year-old in 2011, he joined the Fighting Diamondbacks, a shotgun infantry unit in Florida, for at least four years. In other posts, he described himself as hiding from the war.\nCriticism and discussion As Titor gained significant attention, there also emerged analysis and discussion concerning the veracity of his claims about his origins and mission, and the future events he talked about. No John Titor or Titor family is known to exist, meaning that who posted as Titor used a pseudonym. The story has been called inconsistent as contradictions between statements at different times have been observed. Holding the many-worlds interpretation as correct, Titor claimed that his mission as a time traveller was to shape a timeline in which many chaotic events of his time, including World War III and the civil war in the US, never happened. In some supposed Titor‚Äôs appearances in the internet and other media segments before his main posts (notably in faxes to the radio talk show Coast to Coast AM in 1998), he stated that he was not able to change the future despite his efforts, suggesting one of the possible contradictions. Nevertheless, none of the specific events he predicted to a near future, chaotic or not, have come to happen (see below).\nSome issues with the technology have also been considered. In one of Titor‚Äôs pictures of a supposed time machine, a laser beam is seen allegedly being bent by gravitational distortion, but the view of nearby objects is not distorted as would be expected. Also, Titor knew about technical features of the IBM 5100 which were not available to the public at the time, albeit widely commented in the industry, suggesting he had some advanced understanding of the machine or computers in general.\nPredictive failures One of Titor‚Äôs earliest assertions was that CERN would discover the basis for time travel sometime around 2001, with the creation of miniature black holes about half a year after his departure. This did not occur. An article published around the time he had predicted about miniature black holes created by CERN (a recurring theme, also ascribed to Fermilab and Brookhaven at various times)was taken by some to be evidence of this claim, but these events did not occur either.\nThe civil war did not break out after the 2004 US presidential election, nor did conflicts or military involvement in 2012. World War III did not happen in 2015.\nTitor unambiguously claimed that the last Olympics would occur in 2004. While it is unclear if he meant the summer or winter Olympics, both have occurred since this time.\nHowever, because Titor asserted that the many-worlds interpretation was proved correct by his time, his predictions could refer to another timeline and not ours, making them unfalsifiable. This led to different interpretations, including that he had effectively accomplished his mission by creating another timeline (despite his supposed previous statements that it would be too difficult), or that he inadvertently travelled to a different timeline (ours) and mistook it as his own, or that all-time travel is pointless if the chaotic timeline would not cease to exist.\nStory and consistency Potential contradictions have been observed in different Titor‚Äôs posts. In some of the posts, he claims that he was homeschooled, while in others he states that his basic education was conducted at the University of Florida. Similarly, he stated that he hid himself during the civil war in the U.S., while also stating in other instances that he fought in the war. In some posts, he claims that money is widely used and people still have credit cards, despite his statement that centralized banking no longer exists (this is either an inconsistency or implies the rise of private currencies).\nTitor‚Äôs story could also have been inspired by science fiction works. The use of an automobile as a time machine, for example, had been a key plot device in the popular 1985 movie Back to the Future and its sequels (as the DeLorean sports car), among others. Additionally, commentators have pointed out similarities between the Titor story and Pat Frank‚Äòs classic post-apocalyptic science fiction novel Alas, Babylon. Among other similarities, Alas, Babylon takes place in a small river-side town in Florida just before and after a nuclear war and describes the struggle to survive as a family in the aftermath. In the book, the protagonist lives in the fictional town of ‚ÄúFort Repose‚Äù, while Titor claimed to live in the ‚ÄúFort‚Äù, formerly the University of Florida. The prediction of tiny black holes as a result of time travel (specifically, the sending back of information) is a key plot point from the 1980 novel Thrice Upon A Time by James P. Hogan.\nSome suggested that yet in the summer of 1998 before his posts, Titor sent two faxes to Art Bell‚Äôs radio program Coast to Coast AM, stating that ‚ÄúY2K is a disaster. Many people freeze to death trying to get to warmer weather. The gov. tries to keep power by instituting martial law‚Ä¶‚Äù referring to popular legends of the time about the Y2K bug.\nIn the online story, Titor stated that a part of his mission was to prevent the coming world war by changing history. Yet some claimed that during an IRC chat in October 2000, a month before he began posting, Titor was asked if the future could be changed from his predictions, and answered: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too late ‚Ä¶ I just wish things didn‚Äôt have to happen the way they will.‚Äù\nTechnology Titor provided an image of a detail of a supposed time machine, with a laser pointer beam ‚Äúbeing bent by the gravitational field produced outside the vehicle by the distortion unit‚Äù. The beam being ‚Äúbent‚Äù reveals an inconsistency of objects near the beam not appearing to be bent as well: the framing of the window visible in the background, for instance, should appear distorted in proximity to a large gravity gradient, but it does not. Some have speculated the ‚Äúbeam‚Äù is an optical fibre.\nTitor claimed that he was sent back to obtain an IBM 5100 because it could translate several types of computer code. According to IBM engineer Bob Dubke, Titor‚Äôs statements regarding the IBM 5100‚Äôs little-known ability to emulate and debug mainframe systems were correct. Supporters state that this information was not publicly available in 2000 or 2001 when Titor made his declaration, and Titor himself stated that this feature was ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù as late as 2036 when Unix, as the underlying source behind all computer operating systems still running local infrastructures and other computational tasks, was only two years away from no longer functioning due to 32-bit integer limitations. However, this emulation capability was widely known in the industry and commented on in-depth in numerous publications dealing with both the 5100 and programmable microcode in general. References to this were also available on the Internet as early as 1999 and therefore predated Titor‚Äôs postings.\nInvestigations An Italian television program, Voyager ‚Äì Ai confini della conoscenza, aired the results of an investigation of John Titor on May 19, 2008. Private investigator Mike Lynch found no registry evidence, past or present, of any individual named John Titor. He did, however, identify the John Titor Foundation, a for-profit company formed on September 16, 2003, with no office or address other than a rented post box in Kissimmee, Florida. An IP address connected with Titor also geolocated to Kissimmee.\nIn 2009, a report by John Hughston of the Hoax Hunter website named Larry Haber, a Florida entertainment lawyer, as the CEO of the foundation. Lynch concluded that Haber and his brother Morey Haber, a computer scientist, were very likely the men behind John Titor, whom they introduced in 1998, accompanied by different predictions, including chaos due to the Y2K‚Äúbug‚Äù. John Hughston also reported that John Titor is a registered trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\nIn popular culture  In 2003, the John Titor Foundation published a book, John Titor: A Time Traveler‚Äôs Tale (ISBN 1-59196-436-9), discussing his claims; the book is now out of print. In 2004, Time Traveler Zero, a play based on the John Titor story, was staged in the United States. The 2009 visual novel Steins; Gate, which was adapted into a critically acclaimed anime in 2011, is centred on John Titor and his theories. A civil war caused by SERN (the fictional version of CERN), due to their discovery of time travel, is covered as well.

Tata could team up with the India\u0026rsquo;s Council of Scientific \u0026amp; Industrial Research (CSIR) to carry out clinical trials of Moderna\u0026rsquo;s vaccine candidate in India, the report added, citing officials familiar with the matter. The Indian government this month gave emergency-use approval to a COVID-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech International Ltd and state-run Indian Council of Medical Research, and another licensed from Oxford University and AstraZeneca PLC that is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India.\nThe number of coronavirus cases in the United States crossed 25 million on Sunday, a Reuters tally showed, as states accelerate their vaccine distribution and more infectious strains are found globally. States including North Dakota and West Virginia have injected more than 83% of their allocated doses into residents' arms, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released on Sunday. Virginia administered the fewest doses, with 42% of the vaccines received. The United States has administered at least 21.8 million doses of COVID vaccines, to about 6% of its population. The two vaccines currently approved also require a second dose.

Biden will also extend the ban to travelers who have recently been to South Africa amid warnings that new, more transmissible coronavirus variants are already establishing themselves in the United States, the official said, confirming US media reports.\nMeanwhile, Israel on Sunday announced a week-long ban on most incoming and outgoing flights in a bid to slow the spread of new variants of the novel coronavirus. The measure will begin at midnight from Monday into Tuesday and remain in effect until Sunday, a statement from the prime minister\u0026rsquo;s office said. Exceptions will be made for cargo and firefighting flights, as well as trips for medical treatments, funerals and legal procedures. A panel of health and interior ministry officials will be able to issue exemptions on request \u0026ldquo;for humanitarian or personal needs\u0026rdquo;, the statement said.\nThe decision came with the country in its third national coronavirus lockdown, initiated late December and extended on Tuesday until the end of the month due to a surge in Covid-19 deaths. Earlier Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had announced his government\u0026rsquo;s intention to close the airport, as variants of the coronavirus have been detected in rising numbers.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re closing the skies hermetically, except for rare exceptions, to prevent the entry of virus mutations, and to ensure that we make swift progress with our vaccination campaign,\u0026rdquo; he said ahead of a cabinet meeting.\nLater Sunday, the health ministry announced it had identified cases of a coronavirus variant originating in Los Angeles. \u0026ldquo;In the health ministry\u0026rsquo;s central virus laboratory, a variant from Los Angeles has been located using a sequencing process,\u0026rdquo; the ministry said in a statement. \u0026ldquo;The person confirmed to have this variant has infected four other people.\u0026rdquo;\nVariants from South Africa and Britain have also been found in Israel. Since the rollout of vaccinations last month, more than 2.5 million of Israel\u0026rsquo;s nine-million-strong population have been vaccinated, according to the health ministry. On Saturday, Israel began vaccinating teens aged 16-18, who need to sit final high school exams.\n","description":"President Joe Biden will announce he is re-imposing a Covid-19 travel ban on most non-US citizens who have been in Britain, Brazil, Ireland and much of Europe, a White House official said Sunday, as the new administration ramps up its pandemic response.","id":27,"section":"posts","tags":["corona","vaccination"],"title":"Coronavirus News LIVE Updates: US Cases Top 25 Million","uri":"https://mistrysiddh.tk/posts/coronavirus-news-live-updates/"},{"content":"\r\rOn Tuesday, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) sent a letter to WhatsApp CEO Will Cathcart stating that the new privacy policy ‚Äúraise grave concerns regarding the implications for the choice and autonomy of Indian citizens.‚Äù MeitY also asked the messaging platform to withdraw the changes and ‚Äúreconsider its approach to information privacy, freedom of choice and data security.‚Äù\nFacebook-owned messaging platform has finally responded to the Indian government.

The object was spinning and emitted red, green, blue and orange light at a rate where all of the lights could be seen simultaneously. When a second jet was scrambled, the UFO moved away, maintaining a 25 mile buffer between itself and the jet. It then fired a detachment that chased the jet for a few miles. During this time, the jet attempted to fire back a missile, but lost its controls and communications before the detachment returned to the original UFO. The object then shot off another detachment that hit the ground on a dry lake bed, emitting a massive white light, but with no explosion.\nSpace Mysteries As I was going through internet I found a video where its refueling itself from sun well I\u0026rsquo;m thinking that whether it is fake or real at first glance its seams to be real but it may be fake also. Check the video also see the the video of Restored Apollo 11\n\r\rAs we all know that NASA\u0026rsquo;s camera are more highly qualified and the resolution is more so my main point of question is where are the starts in the whole video also when they send photos from space there are no stars in the photo also when ISS lived there camera feed on YouTube then when the space station goes to dark side of the earth then why do they cut the feed of live stream and says that we are under maintenance, and not also that if you start the live feed in different PC or tab then it will start from a specific point right now if you will try to access it or search on YouTube then you will not be able to find it. Back in 2017 there was a common question raised on Bubbles in space many of reporter\u0026rsquo;s ask NASA about bubbles in the space, NASA denied that there was no bubble in the space but there were bubbles. Here is the video I recommend you to watch this videos in highest quality.\nBubbles in space \rNASA train there astronaut underwater so that it feels like they are walking in the space. In May 15th 2019 Astronaut named Luca Parmitano nearly drowned while on spacewalk.

Area 51 is the place where alien sightings are too be seen but do you know that in year: 1959 NASA took a photo of an unidentified craft in the shape of a flying saucer at NASA engineers at Dryden.\nThis was the photo take by NASA which was been edited but when the photo was been analyzed the hoaxer who created the image, did not even bother to change the photograph identification number. On the photograph in question, you will note it says: E49-059 as a Photo Identification number. A quick search of the NASA Dryden Photo archives, reveals to real photograph with this ID number, and the buildings, engineers, etc. are identical.

They ordered a crash testing regime of nearly every resident there, which was completed in a matter of days.\n They shut down transportation and canceled weddings, funerals\nand, most significantly, a provincial Communist Party conference.\n By this week the lockdowns expanded to include another city on the edge of Beijing, Langfang, as well as a county in Heilongjiang, a northeastern province.

Local officials there had gone ahead with a Communist Party conference like the one now canceled in Hebei, despite knowing the risk of the disease spreading among people.\nSince Wuhan, authorities have created a playbook that mobilizes party cadres to quickly respond to new outbreaks by sealing off neighborhoods, conducting widespread testing and quarantining large groups when needed.\n ‚ÄúIn the process of infectious disease prevention and control, one of the key points is to seek truth from facts, to openly and transparently release epidemic information and never to allow covering up or underreporting,‚Äù the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, said at a meeting Friday of the State Council, China‚Äôs Cabinet.\n China, a country of 1.4 billion people, has reported an average of 109 new cases a day over the past week, according to a New York Times database. Those would be welcome numbers in countries experiencing far worse ‚Äî including the United States, which is averaging more than 250,000 new cases a day ‚Äî but they are the worst in China since last summer.\nChina‚Äôs National Health Commission has not reported any new deaths, but the World Health Organization, which uses information from China, has recorded 12 so far in 2021. The National Health Commission did not respond to requests to explain the discrepancy.\n In Hebei, the province where the new outbreak has been concentrated, officials last week declared a ‚Äúwartime state‚Äù that shows no sign of lifting soon.\n Throughout the pandemic, officials have appeared especially worried about Beijing, home of the Communist Party‚Äôs central leadership. Last week, the party secretary in Hebei, Wang Dongfeng, pledged to make sure the province was ‚Äúthe moat to safeguard Beijing‚Äôs political security.‚Äù\nThe outbreaks, coming after so long with minimal cases, have increased anxiety across China, where residents in most places felt like the pandemic was a thing of the past.\nNew cases have also been reported in the northern province of Shanxi and the northeastern provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin. Shanghai on Wednesday urged residents not to leave the city and announced that people who had traveled to risky areas should quarantine themselves at home for two weeks and leave only after passing two tests, while those who had traveled to the highest-risk areas faced quarantine in government facilities.\nIn Wuhan, rumors swirled that the city could face a new lockdown; while those appeared unfounded, officials noticeably stepped up temperature checks on some streets.\n In Shunyi, a district in Beijing‚Äôs northeast that includes Beijing Capital International Airport as well as rural villages, residents have been ordered to remain inside since a surge of cases just before the new year. At Beijing‚Äôs main railroad stations, workers sprayed down public spaces with disinfectant.\n After a taxi driver tested positive over the weekend in Beijing, authorities tracked down 144 passengers for additional tests, according to The Global Times, a state tabloid. Now anyone getting in a taxi or car service in Beijing has to scan a QR code from their phone, allowing the government to quickly trace them.\nThe government has moved ahead on plans to vaccinate 50 million people ahead of the Lunar New Year next month, a holiday when hundreds of millions of people traditionally crisscross the country to visit their families. By Wednesday, more than 10 million doses had been distributed.\nEven with the vaccinations, officials have already warned people not to travel ahead of the holiday.\n‚ÄúThese measures, if well implemented, can ensure that no large-scale epidemic rebound occurs,‚Äù Feng Zijian, the deputy director of China‚Äôs Center for Disease Control, said at a briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.\nWhile the new restrictions have inconvenienced millions, there appears to be no significant public resistance to them.\n‚ÄúAs far as I am concerned, I think measures like a lockdown for the whole city are actually quite good,‚Äù said Zhao Zhengyu, a university student in Beijing who is now confined to her parents‚Äô home in Shijiazhuang, where she was visiting during winter break when the outbreak there erupted.\nMany in the city feared a repeat of Wuhan‚Äôs lockdown, but she sounded unfazed.\nZhao‚Äôs parents now work from home, picking up groceries only from a market in their residential compound. She lamented that she could not meet friends or study in the library but said learning online has become routine.\n ‚ÄúPerhaps we have gotten used to it,‚Äù she said.\n The response underscored how quickly the government mobilizes its resources to contain outbreaks.\nAfter the lockdown was announced in Shijiazhuang on Jan. 6, authorities collected more than 10 million coronavirus test samples over the next three days ‚Äî nearly one for every resident, officials said at a news conference in the city. Those tests turned up 354 positive results, although some of the cases were asymptomatic.\nA second round of mass nucleic acid testing began Tuesday.\n ‚ÄúIn effect, this is a kind of wartime system ‚Äî using the means of wartime for social control in peacetime ‚Äî and during a pandemic this wartime system works,‚Äù said Chen Min, a writer and former newspaper editor who goes by the pen name Xiao Shu.\n Chen was in Wuhan last year when the city went into lockdown.\nThe nature of the country‚Äôs governance gave it the tools to tackle the epidemic ‚Äî even if some measures seemed over the top.\n ‚ÄúChinese cities enforce a residential system ‚Äî smaller ones have several hundred residents, big ones have tens of thousands ‚Äî and by shutting the gates you can lock in tens of thousands of people,‚Äù Chen said in a telephone interview. ‚ÄúNow whenever they run into this kind of problem, they‚Äôre sure to apply this method. That would be impossible in Western countries.‚Äù\n ","description":"They locked down two cities with more than 17 mn people, Shijiazhuang and Xingtai.

Since we started WhatsApp, we‚Äôve built our services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind. In our updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy you‚Äôll find:\n Additional Information On How We Handle Your Data. Our updated Terms and Privacy Policy provide more information on how we process your data, and our commitment to privacy. For example, we‚Äôve added more information about more recent product features and functionalities, how we process your data for safety, security and integrity, and added more direct links to user settings, Help Center articles and how you can manage your information. Better Communication With Businesses. Many businesses rely on WhatsApp to communicate with their customers and clients. We work with businesses that use Facebook or third parties to help store and better manage their communications with you on WhatsApp. Making It Easier To Connect. As part of the Facebook Companies, WhatsApp partners with Facebook to offer experiences and integrations across Facebook‚Äôs family of apps and products.   WhatsApp suddenly decided that they need to take explicit consent from their users for giving away their metadata and other information to Facebook, with a ‚Äútake it or leave it‚Äù option. WhatsApp is owned by Facebook.\nWhat does this mean to the common user? Well, as Facebook has been mentioning, they will use this data to better target their advertisements on the Facebook platform. How can one better target you as a consumer? By getting more information about your preferences, likes, dislikes, your income, your disposable income, how much money you receive, your spending patterns and what kind of information you are consuming in your WhatsApp chats and whatever other information they can lay their hands on through their digital platforms.\nNow as the argument goes, if you are not paying for the WhatsApp service, then you have to pay to them through your data, as you are the product that they sell to make money. So, you should be open to your privacy being violated by giving up every information about you, captured from your Facebook posts and captured from your WhatsApp posts. As people tend to have one-on-one chats and often share their deepest secrets over WhatsApp, it would not be surprising if you suddenly start seeing advertisements on your Facebook page that you would normally not expect.\nMost people have experienced the case where one has searched for a certain item, say shoes, and have started getting advertisements of shoes on your Facebook page. In fact, many have had the perplexing experience of merely talking about an item, say shirts, and getting advertisements of shirts on their Facebook page. So, imagine, if you are a closet LGBT, except for your chats on WhatsApp, and suddenly you start getting LGBT related content on your Facebook? Or if you are talking about selling your property on WhatsApp, and start getting Wealth Managers targeting you on Facebook.\nIt is the end of privacy in the truest sense possible. Nothing about you will be sacrosanct. That may be an acceptable proposition to the large population in India, but that is not acceptable to the world at large, especially from the more advanced economies, as Privacy is linked closely to Dignity of life (which is apparently also enshrined in our Constitution). Hence, globally, there is a mass movement of people taking What‚Äôsapp‚Äôs ‚ÄòTake it or Leave it‚Äô offer literally by quitting it en masse. Others are taking more measured steps, quitting WhatsApp slowly, one group at a time, till they are completely out. And where are they moving to? They are moving to Signal and Telegram for now.\nSpooked by this exodus, Facebook came out late in the day to clarify that this consent requirement for data is only for WhatsApp Business and not the regular WhatsApp. However, till the time of writing this article, I had been getting reports of users of WhatsApp getting a pop-up in their regular WhatsApp, asking them to give consent of sharing their data with Facebook, with January 8th being the deadline.\nWhat is also perplexing is that the large number of voices that were against Aadhar being rolled out in India and used extensively, due to their belief that it might lead to privacy violation, do not seem to be lending their voices to this gross violation of privacy by WhatsApp. On the face of it, WhatsApp is giving an option ‚Äì either you accept to part with all your information from WhatsApp to Facebook or you are free to quit WhatsApp.\nNow why is this a non-option for many? This is a non-option due to an interesting phenomenon called the Network Effect. The Network effect in essence implies that if everyone else is already part of that network, then the value of that network is extremely high and you cannot afford to leave it. If your business associates and friends are already using WhatsApp, then you will have to pursue each one of them to move to whatever new platform you plan to move to in order to stay connected. That is an almost impossible proposition. And that is the stickiness of an app due to the Network Effect. And that is why many people will still find it difficult to move out of WhatsApp.\nSo, shouldn‚Äôt the government step in and protect its citizens from this gross violation? In reality, in a rule-based governance system, there is little that the government can do based on the current regulations. The Personal Data Privacy Act essentially says that if you give consent to share your data, then there is nothing illegal that the company is doing and the government cannot do anything about it. If you do not want to give consent to share your data, then you are free to quit WhatsApp. The current regulations do not factor in the Network Effect and hence the unfair trade practices emerging from the Network Effect. This is similar to the big builders getting the gullible customers to sign on large detailed agreements for buying their expensive apartments, where the terms of the agreements are completely one-sided, in favour of the builders. The government did change the regulations under RERA to ensure that the builders cannot dictate such unfair terms to the buyers. It is about time that we extend a similar regulation to the digital world, where digital services that have become a necessity and have become a digital monopoly, cannot impose unfair terms on the citizens of India.\n","description":"WhatsApp suddenly decided that they need to take explicit consent from their users for giving away their metadata and other information to Facebook, with a ‚Äútake it or leave it‚Äù option.

Hyderabad: Bharat Biotech on Friday announced that it will begin the phase1 clinical trials of its new intranasal vaccine for the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in February-March this year. The development came days after the Hyderabad-based firm received the Drugs Controller General of India‚Äôs (DCGI) nod for its COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin. Covaxin, which is India‚Äôs first indigenously developed COVID-19 vaccine, has been given restricted (emergency use) approval for use along with Serum Institute‚Äôs Covishield developed by the Oxford University in collaboration with AstraZeneca.\nEarlier in September, Bharat Biotech announced that it has partnered with Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis for a novel intranasal coronavirus vaccine (BBV154). The phase 1 human clinical trials of the nasal COVID-19 vaccine will be conducted in India and Saint Louis University‚Äôs Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit. And here‚Äôs what we know so far about the company‚Äôs intranasal COVID-19 vaccine.\nBBV154 to be a single-dose regimen Bharat Biotech‚Äôs BBV154 (a novel adenovirus vectored, intranasal vaccine for COVID-19) will be a single-dose regimen. According to the company, an intranasal vaccine stimulates broad immune responses at the site of infection (in the nasal mucosa), which is essential for blocking both infection and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nNon-invasive, needle-free Another advantage of an intranasal vaccine is that it is simple to administer - the jab is administered to a person via the nose and does not require a needle or trained healthcare workers to give the vaccine. This also means eliminating needle-associated risks such as injuries and infections. The vaccine is also ideally suitable for children and adults.\n ‚ÄúAn intranasal vaccine will not only be simple to administer but reduce the use of medical consumables such as needles, syringes, etc., significantly impacting the overall cost of a vaccination drive,‚Äù Dr Krishna Ella, Chairman and Managing Director of Bharat Biotech, had said.\n  ‚ÄúOne drop of vaccine in each of the nostrils is sufficient,‚Äù he had said.\n Demonstrates protective efficacy The company said its intranasal vaccine candidate has demonstrated unprecedented levels of protection in mice studies - with the technology and data having been published in the prestigious scientific journal Cell and in an editorial in Nature.\n‚ÄúMice and hamsters immunized with a single dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S conferred superior protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, more so than one or two intramuscular immunizations of the same vaccine and dose. Post-challenge with SARS-CoV-2, viral clearance was observed in both lower and upper airways. Thus, intranasal immunization of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S can create an immune response in the nose, which is the point of entry for the virus - thereby protecting against disease, infection, and transmission,‚Äù the company said in a statement.\nMeanwhile, Bharat Biotech has successfully completed enrollment of 25,800 volunteers for the crucial, phase 3 trials of Covaxin developed indigenously in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV). The vaccine innovator said Covaxin is a highly purified and inactivated 2-dose COVID-19 vaccine, manufactured in a Vero cell manufacturing platform with an excellent safety track record of more than 300 million doses.\n","description":"Bharat Biotech says its intranasal vaccine candidate against COVID-19 has demonstrated unprecedented levels of protection in mice studies.","id":32,"section":"posts","tags":["corona","vaccination"],"title":"Bharat Biotech‚Äôs intranasal COVID-19 vaccine 'BBV154'","uri":"https://mistrysiddh.tk/posts/bharat-biotechs-intranasal-covid-19-vaccine-bbv154/"},{"content":"Vaccination Approved In a short, eight-minute statement at 11 am on January 3, the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) Dr V.G. Somani announced that his office had authorised two COVID-19 vaccine candidates for restricted use in the country. With the statement, India officially stood at the cusp of one of the world‚Äôs largest vaccination drives. But while the moment is suffused with hope, it will pay to remember at all times what exactly will happen from today: not a well-understood or well-planned event, and still hinged ‚Äì for all the celebration of the science ‚Äì on good luck.\nWithin hours of the UK approving AstraZeneca‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine candidate, the company began rolling out thousands of doses for distribution among the country‚Äôs high-priority groups. This kind of speed would have been possible only if AstraZeneca had assumed the candidate would be approved and had amassed enough doses for distribution at the country‚Äôs doorstep. But while this attitude could seem presumptuous and off-putting at other times, it‚Äôs apparently necessary during an ongoing pandemic ‚Äì especially with a more contagious form of the virus showing up recently, and the AstraZeneca candidate being the cheaper option by far.\nAt least, this is the excuse many people, including some experts, are advancing for rushing various aspects of vaccine production and distribution as much as possible. This is unfortunate. The pandemic is only part of the reason, and perhaps even in the minority, among all reasons that AstraZeneca is accelerating its candidate‚Äôs availability. A major one is that the Pfizer/BioNTech collaboration has taken a big lead in the US and the UK with its high-efficacy mRNA vaccine candidate, with Moderna a close second in the US market.\nAll three candidates are two-shot vaccines, and the total population of the US and the UK is nearly 400 million. So given current manufacturing capacity, no single candidate will single-handedly be able to sate demands in both markets, especially since demand is also high. So all three candidates are certainly in contention.\nHowever, these companies have all been making their moves with at least one eye planted on the stock-markets. Stories of Pfizer‚Äôs windfall and the profits for its CEO when its candidate was approved for emergency use in the US are already part of pandemic lore. According to one estimate, the company is set to make $13 billion in profits in 2021 alone. So as such AstraZeneca is already late, and if it is to catch up, it must become available asap in the US and the UK, and try to press a first-mover advantage where it can.\nPressing the advantage India is one such place. The Serum Institute of India has a deal with AstraZeneca to manufacture its candidate for sale in other markets, as well as to make and distribute doses for sale in India, under the name ‚ÄòCovishield‚Äô. On January 1, the subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) recommended that the vaccine candidate be approved for restricted use. On January 3, DCGI Dr Somani approved the candidate, as well as Bharat Biotech‚Äôs counterpart, named Covaxin.\nThe speed is awe-inspiring ‚Äì but in India, it may also be a quirk of doing business. As The Wire has reported, ‚ÄúAmerican and European governments have promised vaccine-makers billions of dollars to offset potential losses‚Äù in exchange for the makers to start manufacturing even before candidates are approved. But at least as of August 2020, the Indian government hadn‚Äôt made any such promises, leaving only companies that could afford to write-off large losses with the ability to start manufacturing early. Serum Institute was one such company. Its CEO Adar Poonawalla told New York Times that it wanted to get a head-start because it could afford to, after investing upwards of Rs 3,300 crore.\nHappy new year, everyone! All the risks @SerumInstIndia took with stockpiling the vaccine, have finally paid off. COVISHIELD, India\u0026#39;s first COVID-19 vaccine is approved, safe, effective and ready to roll-out in the coming weeks. pic.twitter.com/TcKh4bZIKK\n\u0026mdash; Adar Poonawalla (@adarpoonawalla) January 3, 2021 \rHowever, all of this is scant justification for how much we don‚Äôt know about Covishield, or about the other candidates for that matter ‚Äì if only because we are at risk of fooling ourselves.\nIn Covishield‚Äôs case at least, there is an unsettled dispute between one of its vaccine trial participants and Serum Institute. The former has sued the latter for Rs 5 crore, by way of compensation for a neurological side-effect that the participant has claimed arose as a result of being administered Covishield. Serum Institute subsequently threatened to counter-sue for Rs 100 crore, alleging defamation.\nAs Shreya Dasgupta reported for The Wire Science, Serum Institute‚Äôs response doesn‚Äôt inspire confidence in its version of events ‚Äì more so since informed consent in the context of clinical trials is not as iron-clad an indemnification as some might think.\nAstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine candidate is also knee-deep in trouble in the UK, where an advisory group to the government has expressed doubts about the company‚Äôs claim that the candidate could be more effective if the first of its two doses is halved in quantity. This claim arose from an accident during its phase 2 clinical trials, when a subgroup of participants received a full dose + half dose regimen by mistake, but which still reported 28 percentage points more efficacy. The company got in even more trouble after it became known that it may have cherry-picked data from its trials to share with governments for approval.\nSerum Institute only appears to be following suit. The company is conducting bridging trials in India, which can help find if a vaccine candidate tested elsewhere will elicit an immune response in the Indian population as well. Out of a pool of 1,600 participants, Serum Institute submitted data pertaining to only 100 volunteers to the CDSCO‚Äôs subject expert committee, The Hindu reported. Bear in mind that this is a vaccine to be distributed to over a billion people in India alone, and the committee has recommended it based on data from only a hundred of them.\nAs for Bharat Biotech: the Covaxin vaccine candidate‚Äôs efficacy data isn‚Äôt in the public domain ‚Äì nor are details from its phase 1 and 2 clinical trials and about how the company has estimated the figure to be around 60%. That the DCGI‚Äôs approval is entirely opaque only makes this more of a problem.\nSidestepping criticism Dr V.G. Somani addressing the press on January 3, 2021. Source: PIB/YouTube\nThat‚Äôs not all. The head of the UK advisory group, Munir Pirmohamed, recently said that when the group analysed the data AstraZeneca had submitted for its candidate‚Äôs approval, it found that the higher efficacy in the subgroup of participants that received the full-dose/half-dose regimen could in fact have been the result of a longer gap between the two doses, and not the altered dose volume.\nThe UK has since approved a strategy to distribute the first dose to recipients as quickly as possible, since there is enough data to believe it provokes an immune response. However, we don‚Äôt know how the strength and duration of the response will vary in time, and whether the candidate will be just as efficacious if the second dose is delayed by more than a certain period. And yet again there is a caveat: the strategy to increase the gap between the two doses may not just be because the efficacy may be higher, but also because AstraZeneca may be having issues with supply!\nIsn‚Äôt this a shoddy path to vaccine approval, full of serendipities and experimental manoeuvres? As drug-discovery chemist Derek Lowe said, the pandemic, and the virus‚Äôs new mutation that allows it to spread faster through populations, may still be able to make a good case to support this kind of breakneck speed ‚Äì but neither the UK government nor anyone else actually knows what they are doing. It‚Äôs a dice-roll (with a somewhat loaded die, but still) to be performed with millions of people, in the hopes that a vaccine candidate will work as intended. And AstraZeneca is not alone here.\nAs Sandhya Srinivasan, consulting editor at the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, wrote late last year, we don‚Äôt have vaccines ‚Äì we have vaccine candidates. This is an important distinction because the candidates have been or are being tested in a way that doesn‚Äôt check if they‚Äôre good at preventing severe illness and if they are safe for the high-priority groups who will receive the first doses ‚Äì especially the elderly. Both Srinivasan and S. Swaminathan, a retired scientist in New Delhi, have also expressed concerns about clinical trials overestimating vaccine efficacy by relaxing the threshold of effects.\nBut the most pernicious defence of these practices has been to accuse anyone who asks uncomfortable questions of being ‚Äúanti-vaxxers‚Äù. Anti-vaxx is short for ‚Äòanti-vaccination‚Äô, a movement opposed to using vaccines to eliminate diseases because its members believe vaccines cause diseases instead. Anti-vaxxers are typically supporters of far-right ideologies, but those heaping the accusation on demands for accountability are assuming a similarly extreme, and unfeasible, position.\nIn India at least, the drug approval process might as well not happen, considering the extent to which it is shrouded in secrecy, even as corporate leaders use high-handed tactics and even arguments of nationalism to shutdown complaints of malpractice and wrongdoing.\nVaccine apartheid Piling on top of this is the newly emerging ‚Äì but historically familiar ‚Äì ‚Äúvaccine apartheid‚Äù. As The Intercept reported on December 31, 2020, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine candidate was tested in clinical trials with almost 44,000 participants across ‚ÄúArgentina, South Africa, Brazil, Germany, and Turkey as well as the US‚Äù. However,\n Argentina, South Africa, Brazil and Turkey will have to be satisfied with Pfizer‚Äôs gratitude, because ‚Ä¶ they won‚Äôt be receiving enough of the vaccine to inoculate their populations, at least not anytime soon. Meanwhile, the US and Germany ‚Äî along with Canada and the rest of the EU ‚Äî have contracted for enough doses of various COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate their populations several times over.\n A similar story of discrimination played out vis-√†-vis severe adverse events during the trials of AstraZeneca‚Äôs candidate. When such an event was reported in the UK trials, the company responded by temporarily halting the trials and launching an enquiry based on a set of predetermined, well-understood guidelines. News of the event also hit the headlines worldwide within a day or two. Once the enquiry concluded, the trials resumed without any glitches.\nIn India, however, Serum Institute claims it followed a similar process, as required under Indian law, but which culminated with the participant filing a case against the company. In addition, the event had occurred in early October but came to light only in late November. Other participants of the same trial also said they were contemplating legal action because they hadn‚Äôt been informed of the event.\nIn the richer west, vaccine-makers‚Äô attitude seems to be ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs there to hide‚Äù. But in India, and other similar ‚Äòdeveloping countries‚Äô, it‚Äôs ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs there to see‚Äù. This is why stakeholders ‚Äì which is practically everyone ‚Äì must ask more questions and seek more clarity about how vaccine candidates are being approved and sold in India. ‚ÄòCancelling‚Äô those who disagree would be tantamount to ‚Äòcancelling‚Äô ourselves.\n","description":"India stands at the cusp of one of the world's largest vaccination drives ‚Äì but while the moment is suffused with hope, a lot still depends on good luck.","id":33,"section":"posts","tags":["corona","vaccination"],"title":"India Approves Two Vaccine Candidates but Let's Not Pretend Everything Is Okay","uri":"https://mistrysiddh.tk/posts/india-approves-two-vaccine-candidates-but-lets-not-pretend-everything-is-okay/"},{"content":"I suggest you kindly read both the part so that you can understand on which topic we are discussing on Part One \u0026amp; Part Second.\n Almost all people are hypnotics.

According to Wikipedia\n Project MKUltra (or MK-Ultra) also known as CIA mind control Program, is the code name given to a program of experiments on human subjects that were designed and undertaken by the US Central Intelligence Agency, some of which were illegal. Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations in order to be used in interrogation in order to weaken the individual and force confessions through mind control. The project was organized through the Office of Scientific Intelligence of the CIA and coordinated with the United State Army Biological Warfare Laboratories. Other code name for the drug related experiments were Project Bluebird and Project Artichoke.\nThe operation was officially sanctioned in 1953, reduced in scope in 1964 and further curtailed in 1967. it was officially halted in 1973. The program also engaged in illegal activities, including the used of US and Canadian citizens as its unwitting test subjects, which led to controversy regarding it legitimacy. MKUltra used numerous methods to manipulate its subjects' mental states and brain functions. Techniques included the covert administration of high doses of psychoactive drug (especially LSD) and other chemicals, electroshocks, hypnosis, sensory, deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of torture.\nThe scope of Project MKUltra was broad, with research undertaken at more then 80 institutions, including colleges and universities hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies. The CIA operated using front organizations, although sometimes top of officials at these institutions were aware of the CIA\u0026rsquo;s involvement.\nProject MKUltra was first brought to public attention in 1975 by the Church Committee of the United States Congress and Gerald Ford's United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States (also known as the Rockefeller Commission).\nInvestigative effects were hampered by CIA Director Richard Helms order that all MKUltra files by destroyed in 1973 the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the rtelatively small number of documents that survived Helms\u0026rsquo;s destruction order. In 1997, a Freedom of Information Act requested uncovered a cache of 20,000 documents related to project MKUltra which led to senate hearings later that year. Some surviving information regarding MKUltra was declassified in July 2001. In December 2018, declassified documents included a letter to an unidentified doctor discussing work on six dogs made to run, turn and stop via remote control and brain implants.

Webb, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, with respect to an invention oi Melvin N. Wilson, Jr., and Carl Thiele Filed Nov. 9, 1961, Ser. No. 180,384 12 Claims. (Cl. 73432) This invention relates to space simulators; that is, to apparatus adapted to simulate conditions approaching absolute zero temperature and pressure in the presence of a high level of solar radiation.\nIncluded in the objects of this invention are:\nFirst, to provide a space simulator in which ,a test chamber dimensioned to receive a model of a space vehicle is maintained under conditions of high vacuum and low temperature While the model is subjected to radiations approximating intensities and wave lengths of solar radiations.\nSecond, to provide a space simulator which incorporates a novel optical system arranged to transmit radiations of appropriate wave length from a plurality of sources externally of the test chamber, through a wall of the test chamber in such a manner as to effect substantially uniform distribution throughout the test region.\nThird, to provide a space simulator which utilizes a parabolic main reflector substantially coextensive with one end of the test chamber, and a mating multiple cell reflector Within the test chamber, the multiple cell reflector being so related to the external optical system that the sum of the radiations from the radiation sources are distributed over the multiple cell reflector, and eachcell thereof reflects the radiations which it receives over essentially the entire surface of the main reflector so that the radiations received at any point on the main reflector are the sum of the reflections from all the cells of the multiple cell reflector; whereby the radiations transmitted by the main reflector tend to be uniform.\n\u0026lsquo;Fourth, to provide a space simulator which is particularly adapted to produce radiations simulating the high intensity solar radiations believed to exist in the region of the planet Venus.\nThe 1960s NASA sun simulator , nickname star was for an environment test chamber right here on earth to stimulate the sun found in space. with ongoing all the strange events in our space we could only imagine if they are stimulating certain environmental conditions of outer space, like an artificially created sun. The strange name star could refer to the Blue Star Kachina, harbinger of approaching Red Star Kachina also called the red planet ‚ÄòNibiru‚Äô.\nIs it possible to hide the Blue Star ‚ÄòKachina‚Äôby placing optical illusion\nAn ancient prophecy states that the ,‚Äù When the Blue Star Kachina makes its appearance in heaven , the fifth world will emerge.‚Äù This would be the day of purification. Even though we cannot prove that NASA manipulates certain environmental conditions in outer space, like an artificially created sun, by using advanced technologies without doubt there is much more going on we cannot imagine.1\n Let us know what\u0026rsquo;s your thought in the comment section bellow and also if you have any suggestion then you can mail me to siddh.mistry396321@gmail.com\n  HackerIdiot \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","description":"A superconducting fusion device, also known as the Korean artificial sun, set the new world record as it successfully maintained high temperature over 100 million degrees (Celsius) for a record 20 seconds.","id":35,"section":"posts","tags":["technology","record","artificial"],"title":"South Korea's 'artificial sun' sets new world record, lights up at 100 million degrees for record 20 seconds","uri":"https://mistrysiddh.tk/posts/artificial-sun/"},{"content":"New Coronavirus Strain As the world is set to welcome the New Year 2020, as the new corona virus strain which was been identified in United Kingdom (UK) which created a panic and worry all around the globe.

This mutant variant of the virus alarmed all the expert\u0026rsquo;s as well as Health and Safety departments.\nAbout new strain New COVID variant of the SARS-COV-2 virus has been termed as VUI-202012/01, and its said to be 70% more contagious than the already existing one. In London and other part of the UK, this virus is evolving itself according to environment such as living plants.\nThis plants evolve according to the current situation of the growing world where we continually pollute environment in various way: air, water, trees land etc. even Mother Nature is finding it\u0026rsquo;s way to survive from the pollution created by the human being.

We human being are the only one creatures who can talk and express it\u0026rsquo;s feeling to each others.\nInitial Case Around Mid December this year in UK there were new strain of CoronaVirus virus has been confirmed due to which the authorities announced that it was OUT OF CONTROL, however expect believed that the virus had been around from September itself but was not been spotted as there were no large-scale infection, according to report nearly about 60 percent people were been infected by the new strain of CoronaVirus.\nReporting Country Infections related to the new COVID-19 strain are, at present, heavily concentrated in the UK, resulting in several countries to temporarily suspend the arrival of citizens from the region. A number of cases have also been reported in South Africa, Denmark, Netherlands, Australia and Italy, while France recently suspected that the new variant might have entered the Western European country as well.¬†","description":"Coronavirus (Covid-19) Mutant: Like all viruses, the coronavirus is a shape-shifter.

There was attack on NASA 2001 February and March 2002 where Gary McKinnon6 searched U.S. computer network as many computers as he can and he said that he found a document entitled non-terrestrial officers\nThis excel sheet had ranks and names of unknow individuals. Furthermore, Mr McKinnon went on to say, another sheet had a tabs for material transfer between ship. When he tried to search for the name of ships approximately eight of ten in total - he was unable to come across anything that mentioned them (at least in public), reinforcing his assessment that these were part of a covert and non-terrestrial US initiative.\n It wasn\u0026rsquo;t a standard thing in the military at all, so I took that to be that they must have a secret space-based [program]\n he noted, although he conceded it was open to interpretation that it could be another term for astronauts.\nHe was able to access these top secret documents through a program called Landsearch, which after having gained control over the domain, had the ability to search all the files and folders \u0026quot;on every machine\u0026quot;.\nHe was been arrest in 2002, Mr McKinnon was subject to a lengthy and divisive legal quarrel concerning his extradition to the US, where prosecutors wanted him to stand trial for the data breach. if convicted then he be sentence 60 years behing bars. However, in 2012, Theresa May the UK\u0026rsquo;s home secretary, said that he would not be sent to the US, justifying this decision on human right grounds rest of the detail is here7\nRoswell UFO Incident Roswell is one of the most popular lore refers to the rumors and speculation regarding July 1947, United State Army Air Force balloon crash at a ranch8 near Roswell, New Mexixo9. The Roswell UFO Incident involved the recovery of material near Roswell, New Mexico, USA, on July 7, 1947 and since the early 1980\u0026rsquo;s has become the subject intense speculation, rumor and questioning. US Military actually recovered was debris from an experimental high-altitude surveillance balloon belonging to a classidied program named Mongul. Many UFO proponents maintain that a crashed alien craft and bodies were been recovered, and the military\u0026rsquo;s enguaged in a cover-up.\nRoswell FBI File10 - On July 8, 1947, the FBI Dallas Field Office sent a teletype regarding a FLYING DICS that resembled a high altitude weather balloon found near Roswell, New Mexico.\nGAO Roswell Report11 - Results of a Search for Records Concerning the 1947 Crash Near Roswell, New Mexico ‚Äì Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO provided information on the 1947 weather balloon crash at Roswell Air Field, New Mexico, focusing on:\n the requirements for reporting air accidents similar to the Roswell crash; and any government records concerning the Roswell crash.

A simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system that represents its operation over time. Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance tuning or optimizing, safety engineering, testing, training, education, and video games.\nWhat is an AI? Artificial intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of \u0026ldquo;intelligent agents\u0026rdquo; any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.\nAutomation, AI, Supercomputer, Quantum computers are currently leading technology in the world right now as you know many top leading companies in the industry are using AI, Automation, and many leading technology which help them to make there service\u0026rsquo;s better and easier to control. In video games, AI is used to generate responsive, adaptive or intelligent behaviors primarily in non-player characters (NPCs) similar to human-like intelligence. AI has been an integral part of video games since there inception in 1950s.1\nGoogle also recently revealed it is using AI and machine learning techniques to more quickly detect breaking news around natural disasters and other crises. In a related development, Google said it has launched an update using language models to improve matching between news stories and available fact-checking.2\nThe artificial intelligence for Android devices will be able to affect the user\u0026rsquo;s everyday life.

Johnnie Peoples, a 43-year-old survival flight nurse, became the first person to receive the vaccine at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor on Monday.\n\u0026ldquo;Yesterday, the United States witnessed a medical miracle: The first doses of a COVID-19 vaccine were administered to frontline workers across the country. The President promised a safe and effective vaccine in record time, and President Trump delivered,\u0026rdquo; White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday.\nThese are vaccines that he oversaw the development of, he has great confidence in, she said, adding that Trump wants to see all Americans get this vaccine, with the most vulnerable getting it first.\narticle, she said.\n\u0026ldquo;We were told, according to Healthline, quote, a vaccine will \u0026lsquo;still take more than a year to develop\u0026rsquo;. USA Today warned us that, quote, \u0026lsquo;despite medical researchers\u0026rsquo; progress', a vaccine, quote, was \u0026lsquo;more than a year away\u0026rsquo;. And National Geographic even told us that achieving a vaccine within, quote, \u0026lsquo;a year to 18 months would be absolutely unprecedented\u0026rsquo;. These reports deserve their own fact check: false,\u0026rdquo; she said.\nTrump has not only been an optimist to achieve a vaccine by the year\u0026rsquo;s end, but he has also been a leader, McEnany said.\n\u0026ldquo;Through Operation Warp Speed, Trump, the businessman, and the President, as the innovator, has succeeded,\u0026rdquo; she asserted.\nTrump directed military logistics experts at the Department of Defense to partner with health experts at Health and Human Services to ensure prompt delivery of vaccines and equipment, she said.\nThis includes the appointment of a four-star General, who oversees the global supply chain and readiness for the United States Army as Operation Warp Speed\u0026rsquo;s chief operating officer, she told reporters.\nThe Trump administration, McEnany said, supported clinical trials by working to enrol participants through NIH-funded COVID-19 protection networks and provided funding and technical support through the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.\nTrump also directed industrial-scale manufacturing of vaccines to take place at its own risk before knowing whether these vaccines would be successful. It was a novel approach, indeed, to vaccine development, and led by Trump, she said.\n\u0026ldquo;The results of these historic investments will benefit the American people and will mark the beginning of the end of the pandemic. As the first doses of the vaccine are delivered and administered, we urge all Americans to continue to wash your hands, socially distance, wear a mask when you are unable to do so,\u0026rdquo; McEnany said.\n\u0026ldquo;We also encourage those at the state level to improve the early and aggressive use of monoclonal antibody treatments, especially among vulnerable Americans,\u0026rdquo; she said.\nThe Trump administration led the way, approving monoclonal antibody treatments for outpatient use, issuing two emergency use authorisations in November. \u0026ldquo;Additionally, through HHS\u0026rsquo;s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, monoclonal antibody patient courses have been allocated to all 50 states. Together, these steps can play a significant role, changing the course of this virus.

WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system, referred to within WordPress as Themes.\nExample of wordpress admin panel\nWordpress is the most leading CMS (Content management system) right now in current generation there are also many similar to wordpress.\nList of other CMS:  Wix (most flexible designs) Weebly (extremely easy) Jimdo (AI-powered sites) Joomla! (complex but powerful)  There are many site which are running this CMS top popular site to non-popular sites, small scale developer to large scale developer. My first site was also a blog which was hosted on Wordpress which had limited function after then i found a free hosting server where i manually hosted my site but due to server went down i stopped developing my site.\nThere are many plugin and theme for the sites to customize the way you want also there are some plugins which are payable but give you customize the way you want. It has a large archive or you can say storage of plugins, theme etc. This type of hosting has many disadvantage and many advantages depending on which type of hosting you want. Softaculous is a software which is been used by hosting provider to install different types of forums, blog, portal/CMS, wikis, mail, e-commerce, frameworks etc.\nSoftaculous script install panel\nPros \u0026amp; Cons    Pros Cons     Ability to add or edit pages on your website yourself. Potential to break your websites look and feel if not used properly.   Not have to pay your developer monthly maintenance or hourly rate for changes. You may not have the resource to update website regularly   Useful in organisations, with many content contributors, that perhaps need to audit additions and changes to content being made. Using a CSM effectively can require certain computer skills that you or your staff may not have.    What is headless CMS? A headless content management system, or headless CMS, is a back-end only content management system built from the ground up as a content repository that makes content accessible via an API for display on any device. The term ‚Äúheadless‚Äù comes from the concept of chopping the ‚Äúhead‚Äù off the ‚Äúbody‚Äù.\nWhat does headless CMS mean? It‚Äôs like a shop with no front window. There are customers inside and cashiers processing orders but you can‚Äôt see that from the outside. That‚Äôs how a headless CMS works. It\u0026rsquo;s a traditional CMS (such as Drupal or Wordpress) without a frontend. The page designs are built using a frontend framework and the data from these headless CMS systems is exposed so that the frontend can grab the data and use it there instead.\nWhy are headless CMS used? Because they‚Äôre really fast. And there is normally an interface already available to the developers and users to extend and use. For example, WordPress ships with its own admin panel, article writing section and user management amongst a plethora of other useful tools. This saves both time and money and lots of individuals in this space are already accustomed to using well-known CMS‚Äô. Most of the focus will be on creating a polished experience for your customers and some time spent on extending the CMS‚Äô functionality for any purpose needed. Also, organisations gain immense levels of flexibility by having the option to take their amazing frontend and choose to use another backend in the future if needed.\nWhat are the benefits of a headless CMS? If you have a website built purely with a CMS, every request has to load all of the assets of every page you visit. You can alleviate some of the strain on your server by optimising images, caching CSS and JavaScript and making some additional server changes but it is unlikely to be as good an experience or as fast as a Single Page Application.\nBy using a frontend framework like React or Vue, the application doesn‚Äôt have to load any structural assets after initially loading. Any data which shows on a page within the frontend will come through via a request or a bunch of requests made to the endpoints on offer from the headless CMS. And you can usually add additional endpoints for extra data or alternative functionality. There may be a business requirement in the future where you need to move to another backend for efficiency or for some other reason:\nYou could have the new CMS send out the same Application Programming Interface (API) endpoints as the current system and your frontend will still work the same as it did before albeit perhaps a bit faster depending on what was done. For instance, you may have wanted a custom CMS created with a React-powered backend interface which makes changes to a database hosted with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Other benefits include being able to reduce your server costs as headless CMS application‚Äôs tend to scale better with lots of traffic.\n   Headless CMS Benefits Explanation     Omnichannel Content Delivery Headless CMS can power touchpoints across any channel or device. From websites to mobile apps, email marketing, voice-activated digital assistants, Apple Watch, AR/VR, and more. Content lives in a cloud-first content hub, and deployment is simple ‚Äî nothing to install or manage.   Rapid Content Deployment (via API) A headless CMS like Contentstack offers an API-first approach that makes it lightning-fast for developers to pipe in content. Using our Content-as-a-Service (CaaS) architecture, you can quickly scale or deploy new channels in an afternoon.   Modular Content and Assets Because the content that lives in your headless CMS isn‚Äôt dependent on any specific front-end display, content becomes modular; it can be managed and deployed across any relevant touchpoint without being duplicated or reformatted.   Limitless Integrations that Power Next-Level Digital Experiences The headless CMS allows you to connect content to a nearly infinite array of outside services and software. Your content is no longer siloed from systems like CRM, AI/ML, personalization tools, or localization platforms.
