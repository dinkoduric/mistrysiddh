Somani announced that his office had authorised two COVID-19 vaccine candidates for restricted use in the country. With the statement, India officially stood at the cusp of one of the world’s largest vaccination drives. But while the moment is suffused with hope, it will pay to remember at all times what exactly will happen from today: not a well-understood or well-planned event, and still hinged – for all the celebration of the science – on good luck.\nWithin hours of the UK approving AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, the company began rolling out thousands of doses for distribution among the country’s high-priority groups. This kind of speed would have been possible only if AstraZeneca had assumed the candidate would be approved and had amassed enough doses for distribution at the country’s doorstep. But while this attitude could seem presumptuous and off-putting at other times, it’s apparently necessary during an ongoing pandemic – especially with a more contagious form of the virus showing up recently, and the AstraZeneca candidate being the cheaper option by far.\nAt least, this is the excuse many people, including some experts, are advancing for rushing various aspects of vaccine production and distribution as much as possible. This is unfortunate. The pandemic is only part of the reason, and perhaps even in the minority, among all reasons that AstraZeneca is accelerating its candidate’s availability. A major one is that the Pfizer/BioNTech collaboration has taken a big lead in the US and the UK with its high-efficacy mRNA vaccine candidate, with Moderna a close second in the US market.\nAll three candidates are two-shot vaccines, and the total population of the US and the UK is nearly 400 million. So given current manufacturing capacity, no single candidate will single-handedly be able to sate demands in both markets, especially since demand is also high. So all three candidates are certainly in contention.\nHowever, these companies have all been making their moves with at least one eye planted on the stock-markets. Stories of Pfizer’s windfall and the profits for its CEO when its candidate was approved for emergency use in the US are already part of pandemic lore. According to one estimate, the company is set to make $13 billion in profits in 2021 alone. So as such AstraZeneca is already late, and if it is to catch up, it must become available asap in the US and the UK, and try to press a first-mover advantage where it can.\nPressing the advantage India is one such place. The Serum Institute of India has a deal with AstraZeneca to manufacture its candidate for sale in other markets, as well as to make and distribute doses for sale in India, under the name ‘Covishield’. On January 1, the subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) recommended that the vaccine candidate be approved for restricted use. On January 3, DCGI Dr Somani approved the candidate, as well as Bharat Biotech’s counterpart, named Covaxin.\nThe speed is awe-inspiring – but in India, it may also be a quirk of doing business. As The Wire has reported, “American and European governments have promised vaccine-makers billions of dollars to offset potential losses” in exchange for the makers to start manufacturing even before candidates are approved. But at least as of August 2020, the Indian government hadn’t made any such promises, leaving only companies that could afford to write-off large losses with the ability to start manufacturing early. Serum Institute was one such company. Its CEO Adar Poonawalla told New York Times that it wanted to get a head-start because it could afford to, after investing upwards of Rs 3,300 crore.\nHappy new year, everyone! All the risks @SerumInstIndia took with stockpiling the vaccine, have finally paid off. COVISHIELD, India\u0026#39;s first COVID-19 vaccine is approved, safe, effective and ready to roll-out in the coming weeks. pic.twitter.com/TcKh4bZIKK\n\u0026mdash; Adar Poonawalla (@adarpoonawalla) January 3, 2021 \rHowever, all of this is scant justification for how much we don’t know about Covishield, or about the other candidates for that matter – if only because we are at risk of fooling ourselves.\nIn Covishield’s case at least, there is an unsettled dispute between one of its vaccine trial participants and Serum Institute. The former has sued the latter for Rs 5 crore, by way of compensation for a neurological side-effect that the participant has claimed arose as a result of being administered Covishield. Serum Institute subsequently threatened to counter-sue for Rs 100 crore, alleging defamation.\nAs Shreya Dasgupta reported for The Wire Science, Serum Institute’s response doesn’t inspire confidence in its version of events – more so since informed consent in the context of clinical trials is not as iron-clad an indemnification as some might think.\nAstraZeneca’s vaccine candidate is also knee-deep in trouble in the UK, where an advisory group to the government has expressed doubts about the company’s claim that the candidate could be more effective if the first of its two doses is halved in quantity. This claim arose from an accident during its phase 2 clinical trials, when a subgroup of participants received a full dose + half dose regimen by mistake, but which still reported 28 percentage points more efficacy. The company got in even more trouble after it became known that it may have cherry-picked data from its trials to share with governments for approval.\nSerum Institute only appears to be following suit. The company is conducting bridging trials in India, which can help find if a vaccine candidate tested elsewhere will elicit an immune response in the Indian population as well. Out of a pool of 1,600 participants, Serum Institute submitted data pertaining to only 100 volunteers to the CDSCO’s subject expert committee, The Hindu reported. Bear in mind that this is a vaccine to be distributed to over a billion people in India alone, and the committee has recommended it based on data from only a hundred of them.\nAs for Bharat Biotech: the Covaxin vaccine candidate’s efficacy data isn’t in the public domain – nor are details from its phase 1 and 2 clinical trials and about how the company has estimated the figure to be around 60%. That the DCGI’s approval is entirely opaque only makes this more of a problem.\nSidestepping criticism Dr V.G. Somani addressing the press on January 3, 2021. Source: PIB/YouTube\nThat’s not all. The head of the UK advisory group, Munir Pirmohamed, recently said that when the group analysed the data AstraZeneca had submitted for its candidate’s approval, it found that the higher efficacy in the subgroup of participants that received the full-dose/half-dose regimen could in fact have been the result of a longer gap between the two doses, and not the altered dose volume.\nThe UK has since approved a strategy to distribute the first dose to recipients as quickly as possible, since there is enough data to believe it provokes an immune response. However, we don’t know how the strength and duration of the response will vary in time, and whether the candidate will be just as efficacious if the second dose is delayed by more than a certain period. And yet again there is a caveat: the strategy to increase the gap between the two doses may not just be because the efficacy may be higher, but also because AstraZeneca may be having issues with supply!\nIsn’t this a shoddy path to vaccine approval, full of serendipities and experimental manoeuvres? As drug-discovery chemist Derek Lowe said, the pandemic, and the virus’s new mutation that allows it to spread faster through populations, may still be able to make a good case to support this kind of breakneck speed – but neither the UK government nor anyone else actually knows what they are doing. It’s a dice-roll (with a somewhat loaded die, but still) to be performed with millions of people, in the hopes that a vaccine candidate will work as intended. And AstraZeneca is not alone here.\nAs Sandhya Srinivasan, consulting editor at the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, wrote late last year, we don’t have vaccines – we have vaccine candidates. This is an important distinction because the candidates have been or are being tested in a way that doesn’t check if they’re good at preventing severe illness and if they are safe for the high-priority groups who will receive the first doses – especially the elderly. Both Srinivasan and S. Swaminathan, a retired scientist in New Delhi, have also expressed concerns about clinical trials overestimating vaccine efficacy by relaxing the threshold of effects.\nBut the most pernicious defence of these practices has been to accuse anyone who asks uncomfortable questions of being “anti-vaxxers”. Anti-vaxx is short for ‘anti-vaccination’, a movement opposed to using vaccines to eliminate diseases because its members believe vaccines cause diseases instead. Anti-vaxxers are typically supporters of far-right ideologies, but those heaping the accusation on demands for accountability are assuming a similarly extreme, and unfeasible, position.\nIn India at least, the drug approval process might as well not happen, considering the extent to which it is shrouded in secrecy, even as corporate leaders use high-handed tactics and even arguments of nationalism to shutdown complaints of malpractice and wrongdoing.\nVaccine apartheid Piling on top of this is the newly emerging – but historically familiar – “vaccine apartheid”. As The Intercept reported on December 31, 2020, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine candidate was tested in clinical trials with almost 44,000 participants across “Argentina, South Africa, Brazil, Germany, and Turkey as well as the US”. However,\n Argentina, South Africa, Brazil and Turkey will have to be satisfied with Pfizer’s gratitude, because … they won’t be receiving enough of the vaccine to inoculate their populations, at least not anytime soon. Meanwhile, the US and Germany — along with Canada and the rest of the EU — have contracted for enough doses of various COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate their populations several times over.\n A similar story of discrimination played out vis-à-vis severe adverse events during the trials of AstraZeneca’s candidate. When such an event was reported in the UK trials, the company responded by temporarily halting the trials and launching an enquiry based on a set of predetermined, well-understood guidelines. News of the event also hit the headlines worldwide within a day or two. Once the enquiry concluded, the trials resumed without any glitches.\nIn India, however, Serum Institute claims it followed a similar process, as required under Indian law, but which culminated with the participant filing a case against the company. In addition, the event had occurred in early October but came to light only in late November. Other participants of the same trial also said they were contemplating legal action because they hadn’t been informed of the event.\nIn the richer west, vaccine-makers’ attitude seems to be “what’s there to hide”. But in India, and other similar ‘developing countries’, it’s “what’s there to see”. This is why stakeholders – which is practically everyone – must ask more questions and seek more clarity about how vaccine candidates are being approved and sold in India. ‘Cancelling’ those who disagree would be tantamount to ‘cancelling’ ourselves.\n","description":"India stands at the cusp of one of the world's largest vaccination drives – but while the moment is suffused with hope, a lot still depends on good luck.","id":16,"section":"posts","tags":["corona","vaccination"],"title":"India Approves Two Vaccine Candidates but Let's Not Pretend Everything Is Okay","uri":"/posts/india-approves-two-vaccine-candidates-but-lets-not-pretend-everything-is-okay/"},{"content":"I suggest you kindly read both the part so that you can understand on which topic we are discussing on Part One \u0026amp; Part Second.\n Almost all people are hypnotics.

According to Wikipedia\n Project MKUltra (or MK-Ultra) also known as CIA mind control Program, is the code name given to a program of experiments on human subjects that were designed and undertaken by the US Central Intelligence Agency, some of which were illegal. Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations in order to be used in interrogation in order to weaken the individual and force confessions through mind control. The project was organized through the Office of Scientific Intelligence of the CIA and coordinated with the United State Army Biological Warfare Laboratories. Other code name for the drug related experiments were Project Bluebird and Project Artichoke.\nThe operation was officially sanctioned in 1953, reduced in scope in 1964 and further curtailed in 1967. it was officially halted in 1973. The program also engaged in illegal activities, including the used of US and Canadian citizens as its unwitting test subjects, which led to controversy regarding it legitimacy. MKUltra used numerous methods to manipulate its subjects' mental states and brain functions. Techniques included the covert administration of high doses of psychoactive drug (especially LSD) and other chemicals, electroshocks, hypnosis, sensory, deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of torture.\nThe scope of Project MKUltra was broad, with research undertaken at more then 80 institutions, including colleges and universities hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies. The CIA operated using front organizations, although sometimes top of officials at these institutions were aware of the CIA\u0026rsquo;s involvement.\nProject MKUltra was first brought to public attention in 1975 by the Church Committee of the United States Congress and Gerald Ford's United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States (also known as the Rockefeller Commission).\nInvestigative effects were hampered by CIA Director Richard Helms order that all MKUltra files by destroyed in 1973 the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the rtelatively small number of documents that survived Helms\u0026rsquo;s destruction order. In 1997, a Freedom of Information Act requested uncovered a cache of 20,000 documents related to project MKUltra which led to senate hearings later that year. Some surviving information regarding MKUltra was declassified in July 2001. In December 2018, declassified documents included a letter to an unidentified doctor discussing work on six dogs made to run, turn and stop via remote control and brain implants.

Wikipidia Black Mirror: Bandersnatch is a interactive film in the science fiction anathology of serise Black Mirror. It was been written by serise creator Charlie Brooker and directed by David Slade. Netflix did not conirm the interactive nature of Bandersnatch until its release, though there was much media speculation.\nIn this movie viewers make decisions for the main character, the young programmer Stefan Butler, who is adapting a fantasy gamebook into video game in 1984. In this game you have to select choice\u0026rsquo;s to move forward every path has option to choice and your selection will decide you future action similar to that this movie has the same interface in Netflix you have to also select your action what our programmer Stefan Butler will do this will take you next stage there are multiple ending\nAs you can see in the above picture you can see that you have to make choice whether to THROW TEA OVER COMPUTER or SHOUT AT DAD according to that Stefan Butler does the action. There are multiple option in the movie where you will be confused and also some option will take you backward in the movie for different ending. At a point of movie with selecting the same option will take you to a scene when Colin explain Stefan the concept of PAC-man where the PAC word belong to Program Access and Control\n PAC-man Explanation\nThis also reference to Matrix at 1:15s in the video Colin speak of code IT'S ALL CODE IF YOU LISTEN CLOSELY YOU CAN HEAR THE NUMBER'S this is also reference to Matrix where in first part at the ending of the movie where Neo dies and wake up form dead see\u0026rsquo;s the Matrix\u0026rsquo;s as code flowing everywhere around him.\nAlso not that even in the movie at some post by selecting specific options you may lead to this scene which I never expected to see it in the movie it also included in the movie several time as 21th century entertainment services.\n In this scenario Stefan tries to open window and the bell rung\u0026rsquo;s of the cut scene where it shows the set of filming this scene the fight between Therapist and Stefan. There are many options in the movie which will lead you the scenes where Netflix is been introduced in the movie it has multiple endings as well as multiple Easter eggs the movie also there are some scenes which are not able to found out yet also there are soo many chipper in the movie say for example sound in of the tape Bandersnatch by Stefan butler etc.\nIf you know the Easter eggs of this movie and also some real live incident which believes you that the world which we are living in is just a simulation of the real world where we are just a test subject then let me know and I had found something for you will will make you more interesting to see.\n","description":"Are we been controlled?

(Cl. 73432) This invention relates to space simulators; that is, to apparatus adapted to simulate conditions approaching absolute zero temperature and pressure in the presence of a high level of solar radiation.\nIncluded in the objects of this invention are:\nFirst, to provide a space simulator in which ,a test chamber dimensioned to receive a model of a space vehicle is maintained under conditions of high vacuum and low temperature While the model is subjected to radiations approximating intensities and wave lengths of solar radiations.\nSecond, to provide a space simulator which incorporates a novel optical system arranged to transmit radiations of appropriate wave length from a plurality of sources externally of the test chamber, through a wall of the test chamber in such a manner as to effect substantially uniform distribution throughout the test region.\nThird, to provide a space simulator which utilizes a parabolic main reflector substantially coextensive with one end of the test chamber, and a mating multiple cell reflector Within the test chamber, the multiple cell reflector being so related to the external optical system that the sum of the radiations from the radiation sources are distributed over the multiple cell reflector, and eachcell thereof reflects the radiations which it receives over essentially the entire surface of the main reflector so that the radiations received at any point on the main reflector are the sum of the reflections from all the cells of the multiple cell reflector; whereby the radiations transmitted by the main reflector tend to be uniform.\n\u0026lsquo;Fourth, to provide a space simulator which is particularly adapted to produce radiations simulating the high intensity solar radiations believed to exist in the region of the planet Venus.\nThe 1960s NASA sun simulator , nickname star was for an environment test chamber right here on earth to stimulate the sun found in space. with ongoing all the strange events in our space we could only imagine if they are stimulating certain environmental conditions of outer space, like an artificially created sun. The strange name star could refer to the Blue Star Kachina, harbinger of approaching Red Star Kachina also called the red planet ‘Nibiru’.\nIs it possible to hide the Blue Star ‘Kachina’by placing optical illusion\nAn ancient prophecy states that the ,” When the Blue Star Kachina makes its appearance in heaven , the fifth world will emerge.” This would be the day of purification. Even though we cannot prove that NASA manipulates certain environmental conditions in outer space, like an artificially created sun, by using advanced technologies without doubt there is much more going on we cannot imagine.1\n Let us know what\u0026rsquo;s your thought in the comment section bellow and also if you have any suggestion then you can mail me to siddh.mistry396321@gmail.com\n  HackerIdiot \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","description":"A superconducting fusion device, also known as the Korean artificial sun, set the new world record as it successfully maintained high temperature over 100 million degrees (Celsius) for a record 20 seconds.","id":18,"section":"posts","tags":["technology","record","artificial"],"title":"South Korea's 'artificial sun' sets new world record, lights up at 100 million degrees for record 20 seconds","uri":"/posts/artificial-sun/"},{"content":"New Coronavirus Strain As the world is set to welcome the New Year 2020, as the new corona virus strain which was been identified in United Kingdom (UK) which created a panic and worry all around the globe.

A simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system that represents its operation over time. Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance tuning or optimizing, safety engineering, testing, training, education, and video games.\nWhat is an AI? Artificial intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of \u0026ldquo;intelligent agents\u0026rdquo; any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.\nAutomation, AI, Supercomputer, Quantum computers are currently leading technology in the world right now as you know many top leading companies in the industry are using AI, Automation, and many leading technology which help them to make there service\u0026rsquo;s better and easier to control. In video games, AI is used to generate responsive, adaptive or intelligent behaviors primarily in non-player characters (NPCs) similar to human-like intelligence. AI has been an integral part of video games since there inception in 1950s.1\nGoogle also recently revealed it is using AI and machine learning techniques to more quickly detect breaking news around natural disasters and other crises. In a related development, Google said it has launched an update using language models to improve matching between news stories and available fact-checking.2\nThe artificial intelligence for Android devices will be able to affect the user\u0026rsquo;s everyday life.

Johnnie Peoples, a 43-year-old survival flight nurse, became the first person to receive the vaccine at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor on Monday.\n\u0026ldquo;Yesterday, the United States witnessed a medical miracle: The first doses of a COVID-19 vaccine were administered to frontline workers across the country. The President promised a safe and effective vaccine in record time, and President Trump delivered,\u0026rdquo; White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday.\nThese are vaccines that he oversaw the development of, he has great confidence in, she said, adding that Trump wants to see all Americans get this vaccine, with the most vulnerable getting it first.\narticle, she said.\n\u0026ldquo;We were told, according to Healthline, quote, a vaccine will \u0026lsquo;still take more than a year to develop\u0026rsquo;. USA Today warned us that, quote, \u0026lsquo;despite medical researchers\u0026rsquo; progress', a vaccine, quote, was \u0026lsquo;more than a year away\u0026rsquo;. And National Geographic even told us that achieving a vaccine within, quote, \u0026lsquo;a year to 18 months would be absolutely unprecedented\u0026rsquo;. These reports deserve their own fact check: false,\u0026rdquo; she said.\nTrump has not only been an optimist to achieve a vaccine by the year\u0026rsquo;s end, but he has also been a leader, McEnany said.\n\u0026ldquo;Through Operation Warp Speed, Trump, the businessman, and the President, as the innovator, has succeeded,\u0026rdquo; she asserted.\nTrump directed military logistics experts at the Department of Defense to partner with health experts at Health and Human Services to ensure prompt delivery of vaccines and equipment, she said.\nThis includes the appointment of a four-star General, who oversees the global supply chain and readiness for the United States Army as Operation Warp Speed\u0026rsquo;s chief operating officer, she told reporters.\nThe Trump administration, McEnany said, supported clinical trials by working to enrol participants through NIH-funded COVID-19 protection networks and provided funding and technical support through the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.\nTrump also directed industrial-scale manufacturing of vaccines to take place at its own risk before knowing whether these vaccines would be successful. It was a novel approach, indeed, to vaccine development, and led by Trump, she said.\n\u0026ldquo;The results of these historic investments will benefit the American people and will mark the beginning of the end of the pandemic. As the first doses of the vaccine are delivered and administered, we urge all Americans to continue to wash your hands, socially distance, wear a mask when you are unable to do so,\u0026rdquo; McEnany said.\n\u0026ldquo;We also encourage those at the state level to improve the early and aggressive use of monoclonal antibody treatments, especially among vulnerable Americans,\u0026rdquo; she said.\nThe Trump administration led the way, approving monoclonal antibody treatments for outpatient use, issuing two emergency use authorisations in November. \u0026ldquo;Additionally, through HHS\u0026rsquo;s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, monoclonal antibody patient courses have been allocated to all 50 states. Together, these steps can play a significant role, changing the course of this virus.

To recall, Facebook started testing Collab, an invite-only beta, back in the month of May this year. TechCrunch was the first to report about the official launch of Collab.\nIt is said that with Collab, the social media giant wants to take on the likes of TikTok, one of the most popular short video apps available globally. Just as TikTok, Collab allows users to create short music videos by combining up to three independent videos. While the idea behind Collab is similar to TikTok, there are some differences as well. The app will allow users to club three different videos together and also let them post individual videos on the platform. These videos will be visible to a public \u0026ldquo;Collab\u0026rdquo; feed where users can view and play along with them.\nAccording to The Verge, the Collab app is available for free on the Apple App Store and can be downloaded. It should be up on the Google Play store as well. On that note, interested people must understand that the app is still not available in India, neither on the Apple App store or Google Play store.\nPost the TikTok app ban in India, several made in India short video platforms have been developed. The TikTok app was banned in India earlier this year and it is still not available in the country. There were words to ban the app in the United States as well on account of security and privacy issues.\nRecently, we have seen Facebook launched Instagram Reels in India alongside a few other markets to take on the likes of TikTok. Reels has gained wide popularity in the country and partly been able to replace TikTok.

You may not have the resource to update website regularly   Useful in organisations, with many content contributors, that perhaps need to audit additions and changes to content being made. Using a CSM effectively can require certain computer skills that you or your staff may not have.    What is headless CMS? A headless content management system, or headless CMS, is a back-end only content management system built from the ground up as a content repository that makes content accessible via an API for display on any device. The term “headless” comes from the concept of chopping the “head” off the “body”.\nWhat does headless CMS mean? It’s like a shop with no front window. There are customers inside and cashiers processing orders but you can’t see that from the outside. That’s how a headless CMS works. It\u0026rsquo;s a traditional CMS (such as Drupal or Wordpress) without a frontend. The page designs are built using a frontend framework and the data from these headless CMS systems is exposed so that the frontend can grab the data and use it there instead.\nWhy are headless CMS used? Because they’re really fast. And there is normally an interface already available to the developers and users to extend and use. For example, WordPress ships with its own admin panel, article writing section and user management amongst a plethora of other useful tools. This saves both time and money and lots of individuals in this space are already accustomed to using well-known CMS’. Most of the focus will be on creating a polished experience for your customers and some time spent on extending the CMS’ functionality for any purpose needed. Also, organisations gain immense levels of flexibility by having the option to take their amazing frontend and choose to use another backend in the future if needed.\nWhat are the benefits of a headless CMS? If you have a website built purely with a CMS, every request has to load all of the assets of every page you visit. You can alleviate some of the strain on your server by optimising images, caching CSS and JavaScript and making some additional server changes but it is unlikely to be as good an experience or as fast as a Single Page Application.\nBy using a frontend framework like React or Vue, the application doesn’t have to load any structural assets after initially loading. Any data which shows on a page within the frontend will come through via a request or a bunch of requests made to the endpoints on offer from the headless CMS. And you can usually add additional endpoints for extra data or alternative functionality. There may be a business requirement in the future where you need to move to another backend for efficiency or for some other reason:\nYou could have the new CMS send out the same Application Programming Interface (API) endpoints as the current system and your frontend will still work the same as it did before albeit perhaps a bit faster depending on what was done. For instance, you may have wanted a custom CMS created with a React-powered backend interface which makes changes to a database hosted with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Other benefits include being able to reduce your server costs as headless CMS application’s tend to scale better with lots of traffic.\n   Headless CMS Benefits Explanation     Omnichannel Content Delivery Headless CMS can power touchpoints across any channel or device. From websites to mobile apps, email marketing, voice-activated digital assistants, Apple Watch, AR/VR, and more. Content lives in a cloud-first content hub, and deployment is simple — nothing to install or manage.   Rapid Content Deployment (via API) A headless CMS like Contentstack offers an API-first approach that makes it lightning-fast for developers to pipe in content. Using our Content-as-a-Service (CaaS) architecture, you can quickly scale or deploy new channels in an afternoon.   Modular Content and Assets Because the content that lives in your headless CMS isn’t dependent on any specific front-end display, content becomes modular; it can be managed and deployed across any relevant touchpoint without being duplicated or reformatted.   Limitless Integrations that Power Next-Level Digital Experiences The headless CMS allows you to connect content to a nearly infinite array of outside services and software. Your content is no longer siloed from systems like CRM, AI/ML, personalization tools, or localization platforms.
