        <description>What is Simulation? A simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system that represents its operation over time. Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance tuning or optimizing, safety engineering, testing, training, education, and video games.
What is an AI? Artificial intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of &amp;ldquo;intelligent agents&amp;rdquo; any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.</description>

        <description>The development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccine in such a short span of time is a &amp;ldquo;miracle&amp;rdquo;, the White House has said, slamming a section of the US media for deriding President Donald Trump for promising Americans that the vaccine would be available by the end of this year.
US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer began shipping the first batches of its long-awaited and newly-authorised coronavirus vaccine out of a Michigan warehouse on Sunday, setting in motion the biggest vaccination drive in American history.</description>

It is said that with Collab, the social media giant wants to take on the likes of TikTok, one of the most popular short video apps available globally.</description>
