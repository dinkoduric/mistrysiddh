        <description>KSTAR Credit: National Research Council of Science &amp;amp; Techonology
Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) conducted a superconducting fusion device also known as Korean Artificial Sun, set the new world record of recording the high temperature plasma for 20 seconds with an ion temperature over 100 million degrees (Celsius).
This reading were been taken on 24th November (Tuesday), KSTAR Research Center at the Korea Institute of Fusion Energy (KFE) announced that in a joint research with the Seoul National University (SNU) and Columbia University of the United States succeeded in continuous operation of plasma for 20 second with an ion-temperature higher then 100 million degrees, which one of the core condition of nuclear fusion in the 2020 KSTAR Plasma Campaign.</description>

        <description>What is Simulation? A simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system that represents its operation over time. Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance tuning or optimizing, safety engineering, testing, training, education, and video games.
What is an AI? Artificial intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of &amp;ldquo;intelligent agents&amp;rdquo; any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.</description>
