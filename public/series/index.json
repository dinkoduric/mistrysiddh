Where each and every human which are living in the world where everything is normal but its not its just a simulation where all the human beings are been produces in the field where food are been produced right now in the current world here is the images of it.\nHuman Growing field\nNeo wake\u0026rsquo;s up\nNeo looking at another sleeping pods where other are been still connected to simulation\nGary McKinnon Some time I also feel like I\u0026rsquo;m living in a simulation where everything is been programmed, there are many things which are been hidden from us by government need to reply us. There was attack on NASA 2001 February and March 2002 where Gary McKinnon6 searched U.S. computer network as many computers as he can and he said that he found a document entitled non-terrestrial officers\nThis excel sheet had ranks and names of unknow individuals. Furthermore, Mr McKinnon went on to say, another sheet had a tabs for material transfer between ship. When he tried to search for the name of ships approximately eight of ten in total - he was unable to come across anything that mentioned them (at least in public), reinforcing his assessment that these were part of a covert and non-terrestrial US initiative.\n It wasn\u0026rsquo;t a standard thing in the military at all, so I took that to be that they must have a secret space-based [program]\n he noted, although he conceded it was open to interpretation that it could be another term for astronauts.\nHe was able to access these top secret documents through a program called Landsearch, which after having gained control over the domain, had the ability to search all the files and folders \u0026quot;on every machine\u0026quot;.\nHe was been arrest in 2002, Mr McKinnon was subject to a lengthy and divisive legal quarrel concerning his extradition to the US, where prosecutors wanted him to stand trial for the data breach. if convicted then he be sentence 60 years behing bars. However, in 2012, Theresa May the UK\u0026rsquo;s home secretary, said that he would not be sent to the US, justifying this decision on human right grounds rest of the detail is here7\nRoswell UFO Incident Roswell is one of the most popular lore refers to the rumors and speculation regarding July 1947, United State Army Air Force balloon crash at a ranch8 near Roswell, New Mexixo9. The Roswell UFO Incident involved the recovery of material near Roswell, New Mexico, USA, on July 7, 1947 and since the early 1980\u0026rsquo;s has become the subject intense speculation, rumor and questioning. US Military actually recovered was debris from an experimental high-altitude surveillance balloon belonging to a classidied program named Mongul. Many UFO proponents maintain that a crashed alien craft and bodies were been recovered, and the military\u0026rsquo;s enguaged in a cover-up.\nRoswell FBI File10 - On July 8, 1947, the FBI Dallas Field Office sent a teletype regarding a FLYING DICS that resembled a high altitude weather balloon found near Roswell, New Mexico.\nGAO Roswell Report11 - Results of a Search for Records Concerning the 1947 Crash Near Roswell, New Mexico – Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO provided information on the 1947 weather balloon crash at Roswell Air Field, New Mexico, focusing on:\n the requirements for reporting air accidents similar to the Roswell crash; and any government records concerning the Roswell crash.

A simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system that represents its operation over time. Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance tuning or optimizing, safety engineering, testing, training, education, and video games.\nWhat is an AI? Artificial intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of \u0026ldquo;intelligent agents\u0026rdquo; any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.\nAutomation, AI, Supercomputer, Quantum computers are currently leading technology in the world right now as you know many top leading companies in the industry are using AI, Automation, and many leading technology which help them to make there service\u0026rsquo;s better and easier to control. In video games, AI is used to generate responsive, adaptive or intelligent behaviors primarily in non-player characters (NPCs) similar to human-like intelligence. AI has been an integral part of video games since there inception in 1950s.1\nGoogle also recently revealed it is using AI and machine learning techniques to more quickly detect breaking news around natural disasters and other crises. In a related development, Google said it has launched an update using language models to improve matching between news stories and available fact-checking.2\nThe artificial intelligence for Android devices will be able to affect the user\u0026rsquo;s everyday life. For example, right now an AI app for Android can calculate the distance you walked on any given day as well as how many steps you have taken, how many flights of stairs you climbed and many other physical activity data.3\nThe truth behind Facebook AI inventing a new language In back 2017 one of the most talking question about Why did Facebook shut down its own AI after its Bot invented its own language? most of online articles mislead the topic at that time, but the original question was Was Facebook right to shut down it's AI after it invented its own language?4\n Bob: i can i i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nAlice: balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to\nBob: you i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nAlice: balls have a ball to me to me to me to me to me to me to me\nBob: i i can i i i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nAlice: balls have a ball to me to me to me to me to me to me to me\nBob: i . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nAlice: balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to\nBob: you i i i i i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nAlice: balls have 0 to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to\nBob: you i i i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nAlice: balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to\n As above you can see the chat between Bob and Alice I\u0026rsquo;m not a cyber expert or some kind of decipher expert I leave it up-to you 😅.

Johnnie Peoples, a 43-year-old survival flight nurse, became the first person to receive the vaccine at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor on Monday.\n\u0026ldquo;Yesterday, the United States witnessed a medical miracle: The first doses of a COVID-19 vaccine were administered to frontline workers across the country. The President promised a safe and effective vaccine in record time, and President Trump delivered,\u0026rdquo; White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday.\nThese are vaccines that he oversaw the development of, he has great confidence in, she said, adding that Trump wants to see all Americans get this vaccine, with the most vulnerable getting it first.\narticle, she said.\n\u0026ldquo;We were told, according to Healthline, quote, a vaccine will \u0026lsquo;still take more than a year to develop\u0026rsquo;. USA Today warned us that, quote, \u0026lsquo;despite medical researchers\u0026rsquo; progress', a vaccine, quote, was \u0026lsquo;more than a year away\u0026rsquo;. And National Geographic even told us that achieving a vaccine within, quote, \u0026lsquo;a year to 18 months would be absolutely unprecedented\u0026rsquo;. These reports deserve their own fact check: false,\u0026rdquo; she said.\nTrump has not only been an optimist to achieve a vaccine by the year\u0026rsquo;s end, but he has also been a leader, McEnany said.\n\u0026ldquo;Through Operation Warp Speed, Trump, the businessman, and the President, as the innovator, has succeeded,\u0026rdquo; she asserted.\nTrump directed military logistics experts at the Department of Defense to partner with health experts at Health and Human Services to ensure prompt delivery of vaccines and equipment, she said.\nThis includes the appointment of a four-star General, who oversees the global supply chain and readiness for the United States Army as Operation Warp Speed\u0026rsquo;s chief operating officer, she told reporters.\nThe Trump administration, McEnany said, supported clinical trials by working to enrol participants through NIH-funded COVID-19 protection networks and provided funding and technical support through the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.\nTrump also directed industrial-scale manufacturing of vaccines to take place at its own risk before knowing whether these vaccines would be successful. It was a novel approach, indeed, to vaccine development, and led by Trump, she said.\n\u0026ldquo;The results of these historic investments will benefit the American people and will mark the beginning of the end of the pandemic. As the first doses of the vaccine are delivered and administered, we urge all Americans to continue to wash your hands, socially distance, wear a mask when you are unable to do so,\u0026rdquo; McEnany said.\n\u0026ldquo;We also encourage those at the state level to improve the early and aggressive use of monoclonal antibody treatments, especially among vulnerable Americans,\u0026rdquo; she said.\nThe Trump administration led the way, approving monoclonal antibody treatments for outpatient use, issuing two emergency use authorisations in November. \u0026ldquo;Additionally, through HHS\u0026rsquo;s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, monoclonal antibody patient courses have been allocated to all 50 states. Together, these steps can play a significant role, changing the course of this virus.

To recall, Facebook started testing Collab, an invite-only beta, back in the month of May this year. TechCrunch was the first to report about the official launch of Collab.\nIt is said that with Collab, the social media giant wants to take on the likes of TikTok, one of the most popular short video apps available globally. Just as TikTok, Collab allows users to create short music videos by combining up to three independent videos. While the idea behind Collab is similar to TikTok, there are some differences as well. The app will allow users to club three different videos together and also let them post individual videos on the platform. These videos will be visible to a public \u0026ldquo;Collab\u0026rdquo; feed where users can view and play along with them.\nAccording to The Verge, the Collab app is available for free on the Apple App Store and can be downloaded. It should be up on the Google Play store as well. On that note, interested people must understand that the app is still not available in India, neither on the Apple App store or Google Play store.\nPost the TikTok app ban in India, several made in India short video platforms have been developed. The TikTok app was banned in India earlier this year and it is still not available in the country. There were words to ban the app in the United States as well on account of security and privacy issues.\nRecently, we have seen Facebook launched Instagram Reels in India alongside a few other markets to take on the likes of TikTok. Reels has gained wide popularity in the country and partly been able to replace TikTok.

Features include a plugin architecture and a template system, referred to within WordPress as Themes.\nExample of wordpress admin panel\nWordpress is the most leading CMS (Content management system) right now in current generation there are also many similar to wordpress.\nList of other CMS:  Wix (most flexible designs) Weebly (extremely easy) Jimdo (AI-powered sites) Joomla!

You may not have the resource to update website regularly   Useful in organisations, with many content contributors, that perhaps need to audit additions and changes to content being made. Using a CSM effectively can require certain computer skills that you or your staff may not have.    What is headless CMS? A headless content management system, or headless CMS, is a back-end only content management system built from the ground up as a content repository that makes content accessible via an API for display on any device. The term “headless” comes from the concept of chopping the “head” off the “body”.\nWhat does headless CMS mean? It’s like a shop with no front window. There are customers inside and cashiers processing orders but you can’t see that from the outside. That’s how a headless CMS works. It\u0026rsquo;s a traditional CMS (such as Drupal or Wordpress) without a frontend. The page designs are built using a frontend framework and the data from these headless CMS systems is exposed so that the frontend can grab the data and use it there instead.\nWhy are headless CMS used? Because they’re really fast. And there is normally an interface already available to the developers and users to extend and use. For example, WordPress ships with its own admin panel, article writing section and user management amongst a plethora of other useful tools. This saves both time and money and lots of individuals in this space are already accustomed to using well-known CMS’. Most of the focus will be on creating a polished experience for your customers and some time spent on extending the CMS’ functionality for any purpose needed. Also, organisations gain immense levels of flexibility by having the option to take their amazing frontend and choose to use another backend in the future if needed.\nWhat are the benefits of a headless CMS? If you have a website built purely with a CMS, every request has to load all of the assets of every page you visit. You can alleviate some of the strain on your server by optimising images, caching CSS and JavaScript and making some additional server changes but it is unlikely to be as good an experience or as fast as a Single Page Application.\nBy using a frontend framework like React or Vue, the application doesn’t have to load any structural assets after initially loading. Any data which shows on a page within the frontend will come through via a request or a bunch of requests made to the endpoints on offer from the headless CMS. And you can usually add additional endpoints for extra data or alternative functionality. There may be a business requirement in the future where you need to move to another backend for efficiency or for some other reason:\nYou could have the new CMS send out the same Application Programming Interface (API) endpoints as the current system and your frontend will still work the same as it did before albeit perhaps a bit faster depending on what was done. For instance, you may have wanted a custom CMS created with a React-powered backend interface which makes changes to a database hosted with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Other benefits include being able to reduce your server costs as headless CMS application’s tend to scale better with lots of traffic.\n   Headless CMS Benefits Explanation     Omnichannel Content Delivery Headless CMS can power touchpoints across any channel or device. From websites to mobile apps, email marketing, voice-activated digital assistants, Apple Watch, AR/VR, and more. Content lives in a cloud-first content hub, and deployment is simple — nothing to install or manage.   Rapid Content Deployment (via API) A headless CMS like Contentstack offers an API-first approach that makes it lightning-fast for developers to pipe in content. Using our Content-as-a-Service (CaaS) architecture, you can quickly scale or deploy new channels in an afternoon.   Modular Content and Assets Because the content that lives in your headless CMS isn’t dependent on any specific front-end display, content becomes modular; it can be managed and deployed across any relevant touchpoint without being duplicated or reformatted.   Limitless Integrations that Power Next-Level Digital Experiences The headless CMS allows you to connect content to a nearly infinite array of outside services and software. Your content is no longer siloed from systems like CRM, AI/ML, personalization tools, or localization platforms.
