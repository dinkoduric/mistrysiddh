        <description>By Steven Lee Myers
When a handful of new coronavirus cases materialized this month in a province surrounding Beijing — apparently spread at a village wedding party — Chinese authorities bolted into action.

        <description>What you need to know about Bharat Biotech’s intranasal COVID-19 vaccine &amp;lsquo;BBV154&amp;rsquo;? Hyderabad: Bharat Biotech on Friday announced that it will begin the phase1 clinical trials of its new intranasal vaccine for the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in February-March this year. The development came days after the Hyderabad-based firm received the Drugs Controller General of India’s (DCGI) nod for its COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin. Covaxin, which is India’s first indigenously developed COVID-19 vaccine, has been given restricted (emergency use) approval for use along with Serum Institute’s Covishield developed by the Oxford University in collaboration with AstraZeneca.</description>

Somani announced that his office had authorised two COVID-19 vaccine candidates for restricted use in the country. With the statement, India officially stood at the cusp of one of the world’s largest vaccination drives. But while the moment is suffused with hope, it will pay to remember at all times what exactly will happen from today: not a well-understood or well-planned event, and still hinged – for all the celebration of the science – on good luck.</description>

        <description>What is Simulation? A simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system that represents its operation over time. Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance tuning or optimizing, safety engineering, testing, training, education, and video games.
What is an AI? Artificial intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of &amp;ldquo;intelligent agents&amp;rdquo; any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.</description>

        <description>The development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccine in such a short span of time is a &amp;ldquo;miracle&amp;rdquo;, the White House has said, slamming a section of the US media for deriding President Donald Trump for promising Americans that the vaccine would be available by the end of this year.
US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer began shipping the first batches of its long-awaited and newly-authorised coronavirus vaccine out of a Michigan warehouse on Sunday, setting in motion the biggest vaccination drive in American history.</description>
