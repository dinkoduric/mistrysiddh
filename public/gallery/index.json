Tata could team up with the India\u0026rsquo;s Council of Scientific \u0026amp; Industrial Research (CSIR) to carry out clinical trials of Moderna\u0026rsquo;s vaccine candidate in India, the report added, citing officials familiar with the matter. The Indian government this month gave emergency-use approval to a COVID-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech International Ltd and state-run Indian Council of Medical Research, and another licensed from Oxford University and AstraZeneca PLC that is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India.\nThe number of coronavirus cases in the United States crossed 25 million on Sunday, a Reuters tally showed, as states accelerate their vaccine distribution and more infectious strains are found globally. States including North Dakota and West Virginia have injected more than 83% of their allocated doses into residents' arms, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released on Sunday. Virginia administered the fewest doses, with 42% of the vaccines received. The United States has administered at least 21.8 million doses of COVID vaccines, to about 6% of its population. The two vaccines currently approved also require a second dose. Alaska leads the vaccine administration tally, with about 13% of its population vaccinated, followed by West Virginia, with 11%.\nPresident Joe Biden will announce he is re-imposing a Covid-19 travel ban on most non-US citizens who have been in Britain, Brazil, Ireland and much of Europe, a White House official said Sunday, as the new administration ramps up its pandemic response. Biden will also extend the ban to travelers who have recently been to South Africa amid warnings that new, more transmissible coronavirus variants are already establishing themselves in the United States, the official said, confirming US media reports.\nMeanwhile, Israel on Sunday announced a week-long ban on most incoming and outgoing flights in a bid to slow the spread of new variants of the novel coronavirus. The measure will begin at midnight from Monday into Tuesday and remain in effect until Sunday, a statement from the prime minister\u0026rsquo;s office said. Exceptions will be made for cargo and firefighting flights, as well as trips for medical treatments, funerals and legal procedures. A panel of health and interior ministry officials will be able to issue exemptions on request \u0026ldquo;for humanitarian or personal needs\u0026rdquo;, the statement said.\nThe decision came with the country in its third national coronavirus lockdown, initiated late December and extended on Tuesday until the end of the month due to a surge in Covid-19 deaths. Earlier Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had announced his government\u0026rsquo;s intention to close the airport, as variants of the coronavirus have been detected in rising numbers.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re closing the skies hermetically, except for rare exceptions, to prevent the entry of virus mutations, and to ensure that we make swift progress with our vaccination campaign,\u0026rdquo; he said ahead of a cabinet meeting.\nLater Sunday, the health ministry announced it had identified cases of a coronavirus variant originating in Los Angeles. \u0026ldquo;In the health ministry\u0026rsquo;s central virus laboratory, a variant from Los Angeles has been located using a sequencing process,\u0026rdquo; the ministry said in a statement. \u0026ldquo;The person confirmed to have this variant has infected four other people.\u0026rdquo;\nVariants from South Africa and Britain have also been found in Israel. Since the rollout of vaccinations last month, more than 2.5 million of Israel\u0026rsquo;s nine-million-strong population have been vaccinated, according to the health ministry. On Saturday, Israel began vaccinating teens aged 16-18, who need to sit final high school exams.\n","description":"President Joe Biden will announce he is re-imposing a Covid-19 travel ban on most non-US citizens who have been in Britain, Brazil, Ireland and much of Europe, a White House official said Sunday, as the new administration ramps up its pandemic response.","id":18,"section":"posts","tags":["corona","vaccination"],"title":"Coronavirus News LIVE Updates: US Cases Top 25 Million","uri":"https://mistrysiddh.tk/posts/coronavirus-news-live-updates/"},{"content":"\r\rIn Laboratory As I was telling to you that Nisha is a best of the best creation I every made in my life is that right Ms. N, Yes Mr. S its your best creation of your life and I\u0026rsquo;m happy that we make new generation it will help other to regain parts with the original parts with this technology.

A WhatsApp spokesperson said in an email statement to BGR.in, “We wish to reinforce that this update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook. Our aim is to provide transparency and new options available to engage with businesses so they can serve their customers and grow.”\nThe spokesperson further added that, “WhatsApp will always protect personal messages with end-to-end encryption so that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook can see them. We are working to address misinformation and remain available to answer any questions.”\nWhatsApp privacy policy latest update Amid the WhatsApp privacy policy controversy, Signal and Telegram messaging apps also gained wide popularity. Signal has become the top free app on both Google Play store as well as Apple App store.\nThe messaging platform claims that all messages or chat exchanged on the platform are end-to-end encrypted and can’t be read or seen by WhatsApp or Facebook.\nCathcart took to Twitter last week and further clarified, “I want to share how committed everyone @WhatsApp is to providing private communication for two billion people around the world. At our core, that’s the ability to message or call loved ones freely protected by end-to-end encryption and that’s not changing. With end-to-end encryption, we cannot see your private chats or calls and neither can Facebook. We’re committed to this technology and committed to defending it globally.”\nThe messaging platform previously set the deadline for accepting the updated privacy policy as February 8. The deadline of accepting the policy has been extended further to May 15. This means if you are unable to accept the updated WhatsApp privacy policy by this time you will lose access to your account.\n","description":"WhatsApp privacy policy: MeitY on Tuesday suggested WhatsApp to withdraw the latest privacy policy.

The story is prefaced with a line saying that there is still no explanation to the account and that it will be, “filed away and probably forgotten, but it makes interesting, and possibly disturbing, reading.”\nWhen a bright light in the sky was reported to an Iranian military officer, he scrambled a fighter jet to intercept it. The jet pilot said the light was so bright it could be seen from 70 miles away. Upon its approach, within 25 nautical miles, the jet lost all power to its instrumentation and communication. The object was spinning and emitted red, green, blue and orange light at a rate where all of the lights could be seen simultaneously. When a second jet was scrambled, the UFO moved away, maintaining a 25 mile buffer between itself and the jet. It then fired a detachment that chased the jet for a few miles. During this time, the jet attempted to fire back a missile, but lost its controls and communications before the detachment returned to the original UFO. The object then shot off another detachment that hit the ground on a dry lake bed, emitting a massive white light, but with no explosion.\nSpace Mysteries As I was going through internet I found a video where its refueling itself from sun well I\u0026rsquo;m thinking that whether it is fake or real at first glance its seams to be real but it may be fake also. Check the video also see the the video of Restored Apollo 11\n\r\rAs we all know that NASA\u0026rsquo;s camera are more highly qualified and the resolution is more so my main point of question is where are the starts in the whole video also when they send photos from space there are no stars in the photo also when ISS lived there camera feed on YouTube then when the space station goes to dark side of the earth then why do they cut the feed of live stream and says that we are under maintenance, and not also that if you start the live feed in different PC or tab then it will start from a specific point right now if you will try to access it or search on YouTube then you will not be able to find it. Back in 2017 there was a common question raised on Bubbles in space many of reporter\u0026rsquo;s ask NASA about bubbles in the space, NASA denied that there was no bubble in the space but there were bubbles. Here is the video I recommend you to watch this videos in highest quality.\nBubbles in space \rNASA train there astronaut underwater so that it feels like they are walking in the space. In May 15th 2019 Astronaut named Luca Parmitano nearly drowned while on spacewalk. It is been clear that Luca Parmitano and other astronaut were not in space, instead they were underwater training which means that NASA is using VFX effects on green screen, which explain some of the green screen glitch anomalies.\n\rAt 5:07 Astronaut Scott Kelly Questioned about Bubbles in space as this question was many time repeated on internet its true that the live feed of ISS is been stopped and where as for other live feed which are been held by different YouTubers are fake may be not all but the top trending videos of space videos are fake say for example if you search in YouTube ISS live feed in top 10 search you will get this Space (Official) which is live from May 28th, 2020 if you see its video then you can clearly see that an astronaut with his cam feed going live but when it turn toward another side in the space you can see clearly black color with no stars start the video from start\n\rAfter starting the video from start play the video for 10-20 minutes so that you can see the space with no starts and after 10-20 minutes scroll the progressing bar till -10:29:47 let the play the video for 5 more minutes till -10:28:04 the video will play from the start it means that this vide is been recorded and repeated so it means that NASA has never landed on moon or on mars, also do you know that NASA is been received which was 64 light years far from our earth now its been said that if you place mirror 10 light years far from earth and then when you look at the mirror you will see earth 10 years behind. Area 51 is the place where alien sightings are too be seen but do you know that in year: 1959 NASA took a photo of an unidentified craft in the shape of a flying saucer at NASA engineers at Dryden.\nThis was the photo take by NASA which was been edited but when the photo was been analyzed the hoaxer who created the image, did not even bother to change the photograph identification number. On the photograph in question, you will note it says: E49-059 as a Photo Identification number. A quick search of the NASA Dryden Photo archives, reveals to real photograph with this ID number, and the buildings, engineers, etc. are identical. The hoaxer simply did some fancy Photoshop work – and inserted in a flying saucer to the original photograph, after deleting the actual aircraft. This is the original photo:\nConclusion Concluding from above mysteries that NASA and other space stations are faking us about space and trying us to prevent us to see the truth that unidentified terrestrial begins are been controlling us on the earth and when someone who finds the truth are been completely vanished or been killed in an accidents which are shown that it was been an accident.\nIn next part I will be talking about SID HURWICH AND HIS ‘FREEZE TIME’ MACHINE so research about him and also read on time travel.

They ordered a crash testing regime of nearly every resident there, which was completed in a matter of days.\n They shut down transportation and canceled weddings, funerals\nand, most significantly, a provincial Communist Party conference.\n By this week the lockdowns expanded to include another city on the edge of Beijing, Langfang, as well as a county in Heilongjiang, a northeastern province. Districts in Beijing itself, the Chinese capital, also shut down.\nMore than 22 million people in all have been ordered to remain inside their homes — double the number affected in January 2020 when China’s central government locked down Wuhan, the central city where the virus was first reported, in a move that was then seen as extraordinary.\nThe flare-ups remain small compared with the devastation facing other countries, but they threaten to undercut the success the country’s Communist Party has had in subduing the virus, allowing its economy to surge back after last year’s slump and its people to return to something close to normal lives.\nThe urgency of the government’s current response stands in contrast to that of officials in Wuhan last year who feared a backlash if they disclosed the mysterious new illnesses then emerging. Local officials there had gone ahead with a Communist Party conference like the one now canceled in Hebei, despite knowing the risk of the disease spreading among people.\nSince Wuhan, authorities have created a playbook that mobilizes party cadres to quickly respond to new outbreaks by sealing off neighborhoods, conducting widespread testing and quarantining large groups when needed.\n “In the process of infectious disease prevention and control, one of the key points is to seek truth from facts, to openly and transparently release epidemic information and never to allow covering up or underreporting,” the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, said at a meeting Friday of the State Council, China’s Cabinet.\n China, a country of 1.4 billion people, has reported an average of 109 new cases a day over the past week, according to a New York Times database. Those would be welcome numbers in countries experiencing far worse — including the United States, which is averaging more than 250,000 new cases a day — but they are the worst in China since last summer.\nChina’s National Health Commission has not reported any new deaths, but the World Health Organization, which uses information from China, has recorded 12 so far in 2021. The National Health Commission did not respond to requests to explain the discrepancy.\n In Hebei, the province where the new outbreak has been concentrated, officials last week declared a “wartime state” that shows no sign of lifting soon.\n Throughout the pandemic, officials have appeared especially worried about Beijing, home of the Communist Party’s central leadership. Last week, the party secretary in Hebei, Wang Dongfeng, pledged to make sure the province was “the moat to safeguard Beijing’s political security.”\nThe outbreaks, coming after so long with minimal cases, have increased anxiety across China, where residents in most places felt like the pandemic was a thing of the past.\nNew cases have also been reported in the northern province of Shanxi and the northeastern provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin. Shanghai on Wednesday urged residents not to leave the city and announced that people who had traveled to risky areas should quarantine themselves at home for two weeks and leave only after passing two tests, while those who had traveled to the highest-risk areas faced quarantine in government facilities.\nIn Wuhan, rumors swirled that the city could face a new lockdown; while those appeared unfounded, officials noticeably stepped up temperature checks on some streets.\n In Shunyi, a district in Beijing’s northeast that includes Beijing Capital International Airport as well as rural villages, residents have been ordered to remain inside since a surge of cases just before the new year. At Beijing’s main railroad stations, workers sprayed down public spaces with disinfectant.\n After a taxi driver tested positive over the weekend in Beijing, authorities tracked down 144 passengers for additional tests, according to The Global Times, a state tabloid. Now anyone getting in a taxi or car service in Beijing has to scan a QR code from their phone, allowing the government to quickly trace them.\nThe government has moved ahead on plans to vaccinate 50 million people ahead of the Lunar New Year next month, a holiday when hundreds of millions of people traditionally crisscross the country to visit their families. By Wednesday, more than 10 million doses had been distributed.\nEven with the vaccinations, officials have already warned people not to travel ahead of the holiday.\n“These measures, if well implemented, can ensure that no large-scale epidemic rebound occurs,” Feng Zijian, the deputy director of China’s Center for Disease Control, said at a briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.\nWhile the new restrictions have inconvenienced millions, there appears to be no significant public resistance to them.\n“As far as I am concerned, I think measures like a lockdown for the whole city are actually quite good,” said Zhao Zhengyu, a university student in Beijing who is now confined to her parents’ home in Shijiazhuang, where she was visiting during winter break when the outbreak there erupted.\nMany in the city feared a repeat of Wuhan’s lockdown, but she sounded unfazed.\nZhao’s parents now work from home, picking up groceries only from a market in their residential compound. She lamented that she could not meet friends or study in the library but said learning online has become routine.\n “Perhaps we have gotten used to it,” she said.\n The response underscored how quickly the government mobilizes its resources to contain outbreaks.\nAfter the lockdown was announced in Shijiazhuang on Jan. 6, authorities collected more than 10 million coronavirus test samples over the next three days — nearly one for every resident, officials said at a news conference in the city. Those tests turned up 354 positive results, although some of the cases were asymptomatic.\nA second round of mass nucleic acid testing began Tuesday.\n “In effect, this is a kind of wartime system — using the means of wartime for social control in peacetime — and during a pandemic this wartime system works,” said Chen Min, a writer and former newspaper editor who goes by the pen name Xiao Shu.\n Chen was in Wuhan last year when the city went into lockdown.\nThe nature of the country’s governance gave it the tools to tackle the epidemic — even if some measures seemed over the top.\n “Chinese cities enforce a residential system — smaller ones have several hundred residents, big ones have tens of thousands — and by shutting the gates you can lock in tens of thousands of people,” Chen said in a telephone interview. “Now whenever they run into this kind of problem, they’re sure to apply this method. That would be impossible in Western countries.”\n ","description":"They locked down two cities with more than 17 mn people, Shijiazhuang and Xingtai.

Since we started WhatsApp, we’ve built our services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind. In our updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy you’ll find:\n Additional Information On How We Handle Your Data. Our updated Terms and Privacy Policy provide more information on how we process your data, and our commitment to privacy. For example, we’ve added more information about more recent product features and functionalities, how we process your data for safety, security and integrity, and added more direct links to user settings, Help Center articles and how you can manage your information. Better Communication With Businesses. Many businesses rely on WhatsApp to communicate with their customers and clients. We work with businesses that use Facebook or third parties to help store and better manage their communications with you on WhatsApp. Making It Easier To Connect. As part of the Facebook Companies, WhatsApp partners with Facebook to offer experiences and integrations across Facebook’s family of apps and products.   WhatsApp suddenly decided that they need to take explicit consent from their users for giving away their metadata and other information to Facebook, with a “take it or leave it” option. WhatsApp is owned by Facebook.\nWhat does this mean to the common user? Well, as Facebook has been mentioning, they will use this data to better target their advertisements on the Facebook platform. How can one better target you as a consumer? By getting more information about your preferences, likes, dislikes, your income, your disposable income, how much money you receive, your spending patterns and what kind of information you are consuming in your WhatsApp chats and whatever other information they can lay their hands on through their digital platforms.\nNow as the argument goes, if you are not paying for the WhatsApp service, then you have to pay to them through your data, as you are the product that they sell to make money. So, you should be open to your privacy being violated by giving up every information about you, captured from your Facebook posts and captured from your WhatsApp posts. As people tend to have one-on-one chats and often share their deepest secrets over WhatsApp, it would not be surprising if you suddenly start seeing advertisements on your Facebook page that you would normally not expect.\nMost people have experienced the case where one has searched for a certain item, say shoes, and have started getting advertisements of shoes on your Facebook page. In fact, many have had the perplexing experience of merely talking about an item, say shirts, and getting advertisements of shirts on their Facebook page. So, imagine, if you are a closet LGBT, except for your chats on WhatsApp, and suddenly you start getting LGBT related content on your Facebook? Or if you are talking about selling your property on WhatsApp, and start getting Wealth Managers targeting you on Facebook.\nIt is the end of privacy in the truest sense possible. Nothing about you will be sacrosanct. That may be an acceptable proposition to the large population in India, but that is not acceptable to the world at large, especially from the more advanced economies, as Privacy is linked closely to Dignity of life (which is apparently also enshrined in our Constitution). Hence, globally, there is a mass movement of people taking What’sapp’s ‘Take it or Leave it’ offer literally by quitting it en masse. Others are taking more measured steps, quitting WhatsApp slowly, one group at a time, till they are completely out. And where are they moving to? They are moving to Signal and Telegram for now.\nSpooked by this exodus, Facebook came out late in the day to clarify that this consent requirement for data is only for WhatsApp Business and not the regular WhatsApp. However, till the time of writing this article, I had been getting reports of users of WhatsApp getting a pop-up in their regular WhatsApp, asking them to give consent of sharing their data with Facebook, with January 8th being the deadline.\nWhat is also perplexing is that the large number of voices that were against Aadhar being rolled out in India and used extensively, due to their belief that it might lead to privacy violation, do not seem to be lending their voices to this gross violation of privacy by WhatsApp. On the face of it, WhatsApp is giving an option – either you accept to part with all your information from WhatsApp to Facebook or you are free to quit WhatsApp.\nNow why is this a non-option for many? This is a non-option due to an interesting phenomenon called the Network Effect. The Network effect in essence implies that if everyone else is already part of that network, then the value of that network is extremely high and you cannot afford to leave it. If your business associates and friends are already using WhatsApp, then you will have to pursue each one of them to move to whatever new platform you plan to move to in order to stay connected. That is an almost impossible proposition. And that is the stickiness of an app due to the Network Effect. And that is why many people will still find it difficult to move out of WhatsApp.\nSo, shouldn’t the government step in and protect its citizens from this gross violation? In reality, in a rule-based governance system, there is little that the government can do based on the current regulations. The Personal Data Privacy Act essentially says that if you give consent to share your data, then there is nothing illegal that the company is doing and the government cannot do anything about it. If you do not want to give consent to share your data, then you are free to quit WhatsApp. The current regulations do not factor in the Network Effect and hence the unfair trade practices emerging from the Network Effect. This is similar to the big builders getting the gullible customers to sign on large detailed agreements for buying their expensive apartments, where the terms of the agreements are completely one-sided, in favour of the builders. The government did change the regulations under RERA to ensure that the builders cannot dictate such unfair terms to the buyers. It is about time that we extend a similar regulation to the digital world, where digital services that have become a necessity and have become a digital monopoly, cannot impose unfair terms on the citizens of India.\n","description":"WhatsApp suddenly decided that they need to take explicit consent from their users for giving away their metadata and other information to Facebook, with a “take it or leave it” option.

Hyderabad: Bharat Biotech on Friday announced that it will begin the phase1 clinical trials of its new intranasal vaccine for the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in February-March this year. The development came days after the Hyderabad-based firm received the Drugs Controller General of India’s (DCGI) nod for its COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin. Covaxin, which is India’s first indigenously developed COVID-19 vaccine, has been given restricted (emergency use) approval for use along with Serum Institute’s Covishield developed by the Oxford University in collaboration with AstraZeneca.\nEarlier in September, Bharat Biotech announced that it has partnered with Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis for a novel intranasal coronavirus vaccine (BBV154). The phase 1 human clinical trials of the nasal COVID-19 vaccine will be conducted in India and Saint Louis University’s Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit. And here’s what we know so far about the company’s intranasal COVID-19 vaccine.\nBBV154 to be a single-dose regimen Bharat Biotech’s BBV154 (a novel adenovirus vectored, intranasal vaccine for COVID-19) will be a single-dose regimen. According to the company, an intranasal vaccine stimulates broad immune responses at the site of infection (in the nasal mucosa), which is essential for blocking both infection and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nNon-invasive, needle-free Another advantage of an intranasal vaccine is that it is simple to administer - the jab is administered to a person via the nose and does not require a needle or trained healthcare workers to give the vaccine. This also means eliminating needle-associated risks such as injuries and infections. The vaccine is also ideally suitable for children and adults.\n “An intranasal vaccine will not only be simple to administer but reduce the use of medical consumables such as needles, syringes, etc., significantly impacting the overall cost of a vaccination drive,” Dr Krishna Ella, Chairman and Managing Director of Bharat Biotech, had said.\n  “One drop of vaccine in each of the nostrils is sufficient,” he had said.\n Demonstrates protective efficacy The company said its intranasal vaccine candidate has demonstrated unprecedented levels of protection in mice studies - with the technology and data having been published in the prestigious scientific journal Cell and in an editorial in Nature.\n“Mice and hamsters immunized with a single dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S conferred superior protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, more so than one or two intramuscular immunizations of the same vaccine and dose. Post-challenge with SARS-CoV-2, viral clearance was observed in both lower and upper airways. Thus, intranasal immunization of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S can create an immune response in the nose, which is the point of entry for the virus - thereby protecting against disease, infection, and transmission,” the company said in a statement.\nMeanwhile, Bharat Biotech has successfully completed enrollment of 25,800 volunteers for the crucial, phase 3 trials of Covaxin developed indigenously in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV). The vaccine innovator said Covaxin is a highly purified and inactivated 2-dose COVID-19 vaccine, manufactured in a Vero cell manufacturing platform with an excellent safety track record of more than 300 million doses.\n","description":"Bharat Biotech says its intranasal vaccine candidate against COVID-19 has demonstrated unprecedented levels of protection in mice studies.","id":25,"section":"posts","tags":["corona","vaccination"],"title":"Bharat Biotech’s intranasal COVID-19 vaccine 'BBV154'","uri":"https://mistrysiddh.tk/posts/bharat-biotechs-intranasal-covid-19-vaccine-bbv154/"},{"content":"\r\rEnding It was about time for Dr. S to show his new invention to public.

Somani announced that his office had authorised two COVID-19 vaccine candidates for restricted use in the country. With the statement, India officially stood at the cusp of one of the world’s largest vaccination drives. But while the moment is suffused with hope, it will pay to remember at all times what exactly will happen from today: not a well-understood or well-planned event, and still hinged – for all the celebration of the science – on good luck.\nWithin hours of the UK approving AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, the company began rolling out thousands of doses for distribution among the country’s high-priority groups. This kind of speed would have been possible only if AstraZeneca had assumed the candidate would be approved and had amassed enough doses for distribution at the country’s doorstep. But while this attitude could seem presumptuous and off-putting at other times, it’s apparently necessary during an ongoing pandemic – especially with a more contagious form of the virus showing up recently, and the AstraZeneca candidate being the cheaper option by far.\nAt least, this is the excuse many people, including some experts, are advancing for rushing various aspects of vaccine production and distribution as much as possible. This is unfortunate. The pandemic is only part of the reason, and perhaps even in the minority, among all reasons that AstraZeneca is accelerating its candidate’s availability. A major one is that the Pfizer/BioNTech collaboration has taken a big lead in the US and the UK with its high-efficacy mRNA vaccine candidate, with Moderna a close second in the US market.\nAll three candidates are two-shot vaccines, and the total population of the US and the UK is nearly 400 million. So given current manufacturing capacity, no single candidate will single-handedly be able to sate demands in both markets, especially since demand is also high. So all three candidates are certainly in contention.\nHowever, these companies have all been making their moves with at least one eye planted on the stock-markets. Stories of Pfizer’s windfall and the profits for its CEO when its candidate was approved for emergency use in the US are already part of pandemic lore. According to one estimate, the company is set to make $13 billion in profits in 2021 alone. So as such AstraZeneca is already late, and if it is to catch up, it must become available asap in the US and the UK, and try to press a first-mover advantage where it can.\nPressing the advantage India is one such place. The Serum Institute of India has a deal with AstraZeneca to manufacture its candidate for sale in other markets, as well as to make and distribute doses for sale in India, under the name ‘Covishield’. On January 1, the subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) recommended that the vaccine candidate be approved for restricted use. On January 3, DCGI Dr Somani approved the candidate, as well as Bharat Biotech’s counterpart, named Covaxin.\nThe speed is awe-inspiring – but in India, it may also be a quirk of doing business. As The Wire has reported, “American and European governments have promised vaccine-makers billions of dollars to offset potential losses” in exchange for the makers to start manufacturing even before candidates are approved. But at least as of August 2020, the Indian government hadn’t made any such promises, leaving only companies that could afford to write-off large losses with the ability to start manufacturing early. Serum Institute was one such company. Its CEO Adar Poonawalla told New York Times that it wanted to get a head-start because it could afford to, after investing upwards of Rs 3,300 crore.\nHappy new year, everyone! All the risks @SerumInstIndia took with stockpiling the vaccine, have finally paid off. COVISHIELD, India\u0026#39;s first COVID-19 vaccine is approved, safe, effective and ready to roll-out in the coming weeks. pic.twitter.com/TcKh4bZIKK\n\u0026mdash; Adar Poonawalla (@adarpoonawalla) January 3, 2021 \rHowever, all of this is scant justification for how much we don’t know about Covishield, or about the other candidates for that matter – if only because we are at risk of fooling ourselves.\nIn Covishield’s case at least, there is an unsettled dispute between one of its vaccine trial participants and Serum Institute. The former has sued the latter for Rs 5 crore, by way of compensation for a neurological side-effect that the participant has claimed arose as a result of being administered Covishield. Serum Institute subsequently threatened to counter-sue for Rs 100 crore, alleging defamation.\nAs Shreya Dasgupta reported for The Wire Science, Serum Institute’s response doesn’t inspire confidence in its version of events – more so since informed consent in the context of clinical trials is not as iron-clad an indemnification as some might think.\nAstraZeneca’s vaccine candidate is also knee-deep in trouble in the UK, where an advisory group to the government has expressed doubts about the company’s claim that the candidate could be more effective if the first of its two doses is halved in quantity. This claim arose from an accident during its phase 2 clinical trials, when a subgroup of participants received a full dose + half dose regimen by mistake, but which still reported 28 percentage points more efficacy. The company got in even more trouble after it became known that it may have cherry-picked data from its trials to share with governments for approval.\nSerum Institute only appears to be following suit. The company is conducting bridging trials in India, which can help find if a vaccine candidate tested elsewhere will elicit an immune response in the Indian population as well. Out of a pool of 1,600 participants, Serum Institute submitted data pertaining to only 100 volunteers to the CDSCO’s subject expert committee, The Hindu reported. Bear in mind that this is a vaccine to be distributed to over a billion people in India alone, and the committee has recommended it based on data from only a hundred of them.\nAs for Bharat Biotech: the Covaxin vaccine candidate’s efficacy data isn’t in the public domain – nor are details from its phase 1 and 2 clinical trials and about how the company has estimated the figure to be around 60%. That the DCGI’s approval is entirely opaque only makes this more of a problem.\nSidestepping criticism Dr V.G. Somani addressing the press on January 3, 2021. Source: PIB/YouTube\nThat’s not all. The head of the UK advisory group, Munir Pirmohamed, recently said that when the group analysed the data AstraZeneca had submitted for its candidate’s approval, it found that the higher efficacy in the subgroup of participants that received the full-dose/half-dose regimen could in fact have been the result of a longer gap between the two doses, and not the altered dose volume.\nThe UK has since approved a strategy to distribute the first dose to recipients as quickly as possible, since there is enough data to believe it provokes an immune response. However, we don’t know how the strength and duration of the response will vary in time, and whether the candidate will be just as efficacious if the second dose is delayed by more than a certain period. And yet again there is a caveat: the strategy to increase the gap between the two doses may not just be because the efficacy may be higher, but also because AstraZeneca may be having issues with supply!\nIsn’t this a shoddy path to vaccine approval, full of serendipities and experimental manoeuvres? As drug-discovery chemist Derek Lowe said, the pandemic, and the virus’s new mutation that allows it to spread faster through populations, may still be able to make a good case to support this kind of breakneck speed – but neither the UK government nor anyone else actually knows what they are doing. It’s a dice-roll (with a somewhat loaded die, but still) to be performed with millions of people, in the hopes that a vaccine candidate will work as intended. And AstraZeneca is not alone here.\nAs Sandhya Srinivasan, consulting editor at the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, wrote late last year, we don’t have vaccines – we have vaccine candidates. This is an important distinction because the candidates have been or are being tested in a way that doesn’t check if they’re good at preventing severe illness and if they are safe for the high-priority groups who will receive the first doses – especially the elderly. Both Srinivasan and S. Swaminathan, a retired scientist in New Delhi, have also expressed concerns about clinical trials overestimating vaccine efficacy by relaxing the threshold of effects.\nBut the most pernicious defence of these practices has been to accuse anyone who asks uncomfortable questions of being “anti-vaxxers”. Anti-vaxx is short for ‘anti-vaccination’, a movement opposed to using vaccines to eliminate diseases because its members believe vaccines cause diseases instead. Anti-vaxxers are typically supporters of far-right ideologies, but those heaping the accusation on demands for accountability are assuming a similarly extreme, and unfeasible, position.\nIn India at least, the drug approval process might as well not happen, considering the extent to which it is shrouded in secrecy, even as corporate leaders use high-handed tactics and even arguments of nationalism to shutdown complaints of malpractice and wrongdoing.\nVaccine apartheid Piling on top of this is the newly emerging – but historically familiar – “vaccine apartheid”. As The Intercept reported on December 31, 2020, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine candidate was tested in clinical trials with almost 44,000 participants across “Argentina, South Africa, Brazil, Germany, and Turkey as well as the US”. However,\n Argentina, South Africa, Brazil and Turkey will have to be satisfied with Pfizer’s gratitude, because … they won’t be receiving enough of the vaccine to inoculate their populations, at least not anytime soon. Meanwhile, the US and Germany — along with Canada and the rest of the EU — have contracted for enough doses of various COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate their populations several times over.\n A similar story of discrimination played out vis-à-vis severe adverse events during the trials of AstraZeneca’s candidate. When such an event was reported in the UK trials, the company responded by temporarily halting the trials and launching an enquiry based on a set of predetermined, well-understood guidelines. News of the event also hit the headlines worldwide within a day or two. Once the enquiry concluded, the trials resumed without any glitches.\nIn India, however, Serum Institute claims it followed a similar process, as required under Indian law, but which culminated with the participant filing a case against the company. In addition, the event had occurred in early October but came to light only in late November. Other participants of the same trial also said they were contemplating legal action because they hadn’t been informed of the event.\nIn the richer west, vaccine-makers’ attitude seems to be “what’s there to hide”. But in India, and other similar ‘developing countries’, it’s “what’s there to see”. This is why stakeholders – which is practically everyone – must ask more questions and seek more clarity about how vaccine candidates are being approved and sold in India. ‘Cancelling’ those who disagree would be tantamount to ‘cancelling’ ourselves.\n","description":"India stands at the cusp of one of the world's largest vaccination drives – but while the moment is suffused with hope, a lot still depends on good luck.","id":27,"section":"posts","tags":["corona","vaccination"],"title":"India Approves Two Vaccine Candidates but Let's Not Pretend Everything Is Okay","uri":"https://mistrysiddh.tk/posts/india-approves-two-vaccine-candidates-but-lets-not-pretend-everything-is-okay/"},{"content":"I suggest you kindly read both the part so that you can understand on which topic we are discussing on Part One \u0026amp; Part Second.\n Almost all people are hypnotics.

According to Wikipedia\n Project MKUltra (or MK-Ultra) also known as CIA mind control Program, is the code name given to a program of experiments on human subjects that were designed and undertaken by the US Central Intelligence Agency, some of which were illegal. Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations in order to be used in interrogation in order to weaken the individual and force confessions through mind control. The project was organized through the Office of Scientific Intelligence of the CIA and coordinated with the United State Army Biological Warfare Laboratories. Other code name for the drug related experiments were Project Bluebird and Project Artichoke.\nThe operation was officially sanctioned in 1953, reduced in scope in 1964 and further curtailed in 1967. it was officially halted in 1973. The program also engaged in illegal activities, including the used of US and Canadian citizens as its unwitting test subjects, which led to controversy regarding it legitimacy. MKUltra used numerous methods to manipulate its subjects' mental states and brain functions. Techniques included the covert administration of high doses of psychoactive drug (especially LSD) and other chemicals, electroshocks, hypnosis, sensory, deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of torture.\nThe scope of Project MKUltra was broad, with research undertaken at more then 80 institutions, including colleges and universities hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies. The CIA operated using front organizations, although sometimes top of officials at these institutions were aware of the CIA\u0026rsquo;s involvement.\nProject MKUltra was first brought to public attention in 1975 by the Church Committee of the United States Congress and Gerald Ford's United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States (also known as the Rockefeller Commission).\nInvestigative effects were hampered by CIA Director Richard Helms order that all MKUltra files by destroyed in 1973 the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the rtelatively small number of documents that survived Helms\u0026rsquo;s destruction order. In 1997, a Freedom of Information Act requested uncovered a cache of 20,000 documents related to project MKUltra which led to senate hearings later that year. Some surviving information regarding MKUltra was declassified in July 2001. In December 2018, declassified documents included a letter to an unidentified doctor discussing work on six dogs made to run, turn and stop via remote control and brain implants.

The strange name star could refer to the Blue Star Kachina, harbinger of approaching Red Star Kachina also called the red planet ‘Nibiru’.\nIs it possible to hide the Blue Star ‘Kachina’by placing optical illusion\nAn ancient prophecy states that the ,” When the Blue Star Kachina makes its appearance in heaven , the fifth world will emerge.” This would be the day of purification. Even though we cannot prove that NASA manipulates certain environmental conditions in outer space, like an artificially created sun, by using advanced technologies without doubt there is much more going on we cannot imagine.1\n Let us know what\u0026rsquo;s your thought in the comment section bellow and also if you have any suggestion then you can mail me to siddh.mistry396321@gmail.com\n  HackerIdiot \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","description":"A superconducting fusion device, also known as the Korean artificial sun, set the new world record as it successfully maintained high temperature over 100 million degrees (Celsius) for a record 20 seconds.","id":29,"section":"posts","tags":["technology","record","artificial"],"title":"South Korea's 'artificial sun' sets new world record, lights up at 100 million degrees for record 20 seconds","uri":"https://mistrysiddh.tk/posts/artificial-sun/"},{"content":"New Coronavirus Strain As the world is set to welcome the New Year 2020, as the new corona virus strain which was been identified in United Kingdom (UK) which created a panic and worry all around the globe.

There was attack on NASA 2001 February and March 2002 where Gary McKinnon6 searched U.S. computer network as many computers as he can and he said that he found a document entitled non-terrestrial officers\nThis excel sheet had ranks and names of unknow individuals. Furthermore, Mr McKinnon went on to say, another sheet had a tabs for material transfer between ship. When he tried to search for the name of ships approximately eight of ten in total - he was unable to come across anything that mentioned them (at least in public), reinforcing his assessment that these were part of a covert and non-terrestrial US initiative.\n It wasn\u0026rsquo;t a standard thing in the military at all, so I took that to be that they must have a secret space-based [program]\n he noted, although he conceded it was open to interpretation that it could be another term for astronauts.\nHe was able to access these top secret documents through a program called Landsearch, which after having gained control over the domain, had the ability to search all the files and folders \u0026quot;on every machine\u0026quot;.\nHe was been arrest in 2002, Mr McKinnon was subject to a lengthy and divisive legal quarrel concerning his extradition to the US, where prosecutors wanted him to stand trial for the data breach. if convicted then he be sentence 60 years behing bars. However, in 2012, Theresa May the UK\u0026rsquo;s home secretary, said that he would not be sent to the US, justifying this decision on human right grounds rest of the detail is here7\nRoswell UFO Incident Roswell is one of the most popular lore refers to the rumors and speculation regarding July 1947, United State Army Air Force balloon crash at a ranch8 near Roswell, New Mexixo9.

Artificial intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.

Johnnie Peoples, a 43-year-old survival flight nurse, became the first person to receive the vaccine at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor on Monday.\n\u0026ldquo;Yesterday, the United States witnessed a medical miracle: The first doses of a COVID-19 vaccine were administered to frontline workers across the country. The President promised a safe and effective vaccine in record time, and President Trump delivered,\u0026rdquo; White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday.\nThese are vaccines that he oversaw the development of, he has great confidence in, she said, adding that Trump wants to see all Americans get this vaccine, with the most vulnerable getting it first.\narticle, she said.\n\u0026ldquo;We were told, according to Healthline, quote, a vaccine will \u0026lsquo;still take more than a year to develop\u0026rsquo;.

And National Geographic even told us that achieving a vaccine within, quote, \u0026lsquo;a year to 18 months would be absolutely unprecedented\u0026rsquo;. These reports deserve their own fact check: false,\u0026rdquo; she said.\nTrump has not only been an optimist to achieve a vaccine by the year\u0026rsquo;s end, but he has also been a leader, McEnany said.\n\u0026ldquo;Through Operation Warp Speed, Trump, the businessman, and the President, as the innovator, has succeeded,\u0026rdquo; she asserted.\nTrump directed military logistics experts at the Department of Defense to partner with health experts at Health and Human Services to ensure prompt delivery of vaccines and equipment, she said.\nThis includes the appointment of a four-star General, who oversees the global supply chain and readiness for the United States Army as Operation Warp Speed\u0026rsquo;s chief operating officer, she told reporters.\nThe Trump administration, McEnany said, supported clinical trials by working to enrol participants through NIH-funded COVID-19 protection networks and provided funding and technical support through the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.\nTrump also directed industrial-scale manufacturing of vaccines to take place at its own risk before knowing whether these vaccines would be successful. It was a novel approach, indeed, to vaccine development, and led by Trump, she said.\n\u0026ldquo;The results of these historic investments will benefit the American people and will mark the beginning of the end of the pandemic. As the first doses of the vaccine are delivered and administered, we urge all Americans to continue to wash your hands, socially distance, wear a mask when you are unable to do so,\u0026rdquo; McEnany said.\n\u0026ldquo;We also encourage those at the state level to improve the early and aggressive use of monoclonal antibody treatments, especially among vulnerable Americans,\u0026rdquo; she said.\nThe Trump administration led the way, approving monoclonal antibody treatments for outpatient use, issuing two emergency use authorisations in November. \u0026ldquo;Additionally, through HHS\u0026rsquo;s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, monoclonal antibody patient courses have been allocated to all 50 states. Together, these steps can play a significant role, changing the course of this virus.

Just as TikTok, Collab allows users to create short music videos by combining up to three independent videos. While the idea behind Collab is similar to TikTok, there are some differences as well. The app will allow users to club three different videos together and also let them post individual videos on the platform. These videos will be visible to a public \u0026ldquo;Collab\u0026rdquo; feed where users can view and play along with them.\nAccording to The Verge, the Collab app is available for free on the Apple App Store and can be downloaded. It should be up on the Google Play store as well. On that note, interested people must understand that the app is still not available in India, neither on the Apple App store or Google Play store.\nPost the TikTok app ban in India, several made in India short video platforms have been developed. The TikTok app was banned in India earlier this year and it is still not available in the country. There were words to ban the app in the United States as well on account of security and privacy issues.\nRecently, we have seen Facebook launched Instagram Reels in India alongside a few other markets to take on the likes of TikTok.

You may not have the resource to update website regularly   Useful in organisations, with many content contributors, that perhaps need to audit additions and changes to content being made. Using a CSM effectively can require certain computer skills that you or your staff may not have.    What is headless CMS? A headless content management system, or headless CMS, is a back-end only content management system built from the ground up as a content repository that makes content accessible via an API for display on any device. The term “headless” comes from the concept of chopping the “head” off the “body”.\nWhat does headless CMS mean? It’s like a shop with no front window. There are customers inside and cashiers processing orders but you can’t see that from the outside. That’s how a headless CMS works. It\u0026rsquo;s a traditional CMS (such as Drupal or Wordpress) without a frontend. The page designs are built using a frontend framework and the data from these headless CMS systems is exposed so that the frontend can grab the data and use it there instead.\nWhy are headless CMS used? Because they’re really fast. And there is normally an interface already available to the developers and users to extend and use. For example, WordPress ships with its own admin panel, article writing section and user management amongst a plethora of other useful tools. This saves both time and money and lots of individuals in this space are already accustomed to using well-known CMS’. Most of the focus will be on creating a polished experience for your customers and some time spent on extending the CMS’ functionality for any purpose needed. Also, organisations gain immense levels of flexibility by having the option to take their amazing frontend and choose to use another backend in the future if needed.\nWhat are the benefits of a headless CMS? If you have a website built purely with a CMS, every request has to load all of the assets of every page you visit. You can alleviate some of the strain on your server by optimising images, caching CSS and JavaScript and making some additional server changes but it is unlikely to be as good an experience or as fast as a Single Page Application.\nBy using a frontend framework like React or Vue, the application doesn’t have to load any structural assets after initially loading. Any data which shows on a page within the frontend will come through via a request or a bunch of requests made to the endpoints on offer from the headless CMS. And you can usually add additional endpoints for extra data or alternative functionality. There may be a business requirement in the future where you need to move to another backend for efficiency or for some other reason:\nYou could have the new CMS send out the same Application Programming Interface (API) endpoints as the current system and your frontend will still work the same as it did before albeit perhaps a bit faster depending on what was done. For instance, you may have wanted a custom CMS created with a React-powered backend interface which makes changes to a database hosted with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Other benefits include being able to reduce your server costs as headless CMS application’s tend to scale better with lots of traffic.\n   Headless CMS Benefits Explanation     Omnichannel Content Delivery Headless CMS can power touchpoints across any channel or device. From websites to mobile apps, email marketing, voice-activated digital assistants, Apple Watch, AR/VR, and more. Content lives in a cloud-first content hub, and deployment is simple — nothing to install or manage.   Rapid Content Deployment (via API) A headless CMS like Contentstack offers an API-first approach that makes it lightning-fast for developers to pipe in content. Using our Content-as-a-Service (CaaS) architecture, you can quickly scale or deploy new channels in an afternoon.   Modular Content and Assets Because the content that lives in your headless CMS isn’t dependent on any specific front-end display, content becomes modular; it can be managed and deployed across any relevant touchpoint without being duplicated or reformatted.   Limitless Integrations that Power Next-Level Digital Experiences The headless CMS allows you to connect content to a nearly infinite array of outside services and software. Your content is no longer siloed from systems like CRM, AI/ML, personalization tools, or localization platforms.

Manga is spoiler for anime watchers\nIf you have never read the manga or seen anime then I whole heartily recommend you to start with Naruto any of the manga or anime. You will find tons of site for the manga and to watch. Naruto is a part of my life as if he is alive in myself, I started watching Naruto from 2012 and ended all chapters the manga\u0026rsquo;s and all the episodes of anime too. Naruto taught to me many things in my life when I was in the starting years of me college, when my college started I use to see many couples in canteen siting hand in hand. I was really jealous of them but anime taught that being jealous is a part of your life you have to experience everything emotion of your life if you have happiness in your life that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you won\u0026rsquo;t have happiness. I whole heartily thank all the anime and manga character to give me a new life.\n","description":"Fear he who fear nothing","id":39,"section":"posts","tags":["welcome"],"title":"Welcome User","uri":"https://mistrysiddh.tk/posts/welcome_user/"},{"content":"Click on image to read offline\n","description":"Where it's all began with a BANG.","id":40,"section":"gallery","tags":null,"title":"Engineer VS Robot","uri":"https://mistrysiddh.tk/gallery/roboto-01/"},{"content":"Hi there 👋, my name is Mistry Siddh I am Blogger, Gamer, WordPress Blogger Myself Mistry Siddh, I\u0026rsquo;m a blogger who loves to write conspiracy theories, NEWS, tips\u0026amp;tricks, etc.\n 🔭 I’m currently working on Blogger this page. 🌱 I’m currently learning Nanotechnology, VSLI. 📫 How to reach me: siddh.mistry396321@gmail.com     Top Lang\u0026rsquo;s GitHub stats GitHub metrics GitHub streak stats Profile views             Contact me on:    Github Linkedin Facebook Instagram Twitter Wordpress              Info                       ​\n","description":"Information Regarding author.","id":41,"section":"","tags":null,"title":"About Me","uri":"https://mistrysiddh.tk/about/"}]
